SOS i must speak to hill this moment EOS	14.86
SOS it is not TITLE bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life EOS	55.44
SOS this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once EOS	255.97
SOS after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained EOS	3.80
SOS about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention EOS	19295.04
SOS it is from my cousin TITLE collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases EOS	823.01
SOS oh EOS	22.26
SOS my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned EOS	7.00
SOS pray do not talk of that odious man EOS	28.96
SOS i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it EOS	5.62
SOS jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail EOS	6.97
SOS they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which TITLE bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about EOS	31.51
SOS it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said TITLE bennet and nothing can clear TITLE collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn EOS	28.14
SOS but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself EOS	113.19
SOS no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical EOS	11.67
SOS i hate such false friends EOS	55.23
SOS why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him EOS	407.81
SOS why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear EOS	5.63
SOS hunsford near westerham kent 15th october EOS	9.37
SOS dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance EOS	139.76
SOS there TITLE bennet EOS	27.70
SOS my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england EOS	15.01
SOS as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch EOS	162.47
SOS i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter EOS	10.29
SOS if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day EOS	71.47
SOS i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins EOS	7.66
SOS at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said TITLE bennet as he folded up the letter EOS	65.61
SOS he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again EOS	668.85
SOS there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him EOS	3.09
SOS though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit EOS	30.18
SOS elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required EOS	88.16
SOS he must be an oddity i think said she EOS	5.42
SOS i cannot make him out EOS	133.16
SOS there is something very pompous in his style EOS	16256.93
SOS and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail EOS	103.78
SOS we cannot suppose he would help it if he could EOS	510.40
SOS can he be a sensible man sir EOS	11194.78
SOS no my dear i think not EOS	8.77
SOS i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse EOS	452.75
SOS there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well EOS	9.63
SOS i am impatient to see him EOS	97.36
SOS in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective EOS	44.10
SOS the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed EOS	1.37
SOS to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting EOS	28.36
SOS it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour EOS	4236.35
SOS as for their mother TITLE collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters EOS	14989.12
SOS TITLE collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family EOS	21.50
SOS TITLE bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and TITLE collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself EOS	26.52
SOS he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty EOS	80.79
SOS his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal EOS	14.07
SOS he had not been long seated before he complimented TITLE bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage EOS	7436.66
SOS this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but TITLE bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough EOS	41.31
SOS things are settled so oddly EOS	84.24
SOS you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate EOS	5.32
SOS ah EOS	2.53
SOS sir i do indeed EOS	223.12
SOS it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess EOS	131600.12
SOS not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world EOS	1765.52
SOS there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed EOS	1124.99
SOS i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate EOS	12.58
SOS but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them EOS	62.77
SOS at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other EOS	55.74
SOS they were not the only objects of TITLE collins s admiration EOS	1374.43
SOS the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched TITLE bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property EOS	280.71
SOS the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing EOS	1118.92
SOS but here he was set right by TITLE bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen EOS	1262.79
SOS he begged pardon for having displeased her EOS	5.74
SOS in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour EOS	2492.72
SOS during dinner TITLE bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness EOS	23.26
SOS lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable EOS	139.63
SOS TITLE bennet could not have chosen better EOS	67.56
SOS TITLE collins was eloquent in her praise EOS	71.73
SOS the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine EOS	4825.64
SOS she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her EOS	199.06
SOS she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening EOS	6.71
SOS lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her EOS	28.66
SOS she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations EOS	6765.00
SOS she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs EOS	16.01
SOS that is all very proper and civil i am sure said TITLE bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman EOS	41.14
SOS it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her EOS	389.27
SOS does she live near you sir EOS	64.41
SOS the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence EOS	5490.29
SOS i think you said she was a widow sir EOS	70.12
SOS has she any family EOS	147.46
SOS she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property EOS	62.49
SOS ah EOS	165.74
SOS cried TITLE bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls EOS	8.81
SOS and what sort of young lady is she EOS	60.25
SOS is she handsome EOS	1654.11
SOS she is a most charming young lady indeed EOS	51.32
SOS lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth EOS	257.11
SOS she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them EOS	16721.68
SOS but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies EOS	5.31
SOS has she been presented EOS	3096.95
SOS i do not remember her name among the ladies at court EOS	46315.80
SOS her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament EOS	850.63
SOS her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies EOS	5.94
SOS i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her EOS	28.96
SOS these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay EOS	5.62
SOS you judge very properly said TITLE bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy EOS	1000.75
SOS may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study EOS	10.96
SOS they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible EOS	114.84
SOS TITLE bennet s expectations were fully answered EOS	5.71
SOS his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure EOS	22.70
SOS by tea time however the dose had been enough and TITLE bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies EOS	76.32
SOS TITLE collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels EOS	641.88
SOS kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed EOS	15.45
SOS other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons EOS	7.89
SOS lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him EOS	7944.79
SOS my aunt told me so herself on saturday EOS	4529.07
SOS i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when TITLE denny comes back from town EOS	2326.92
SOS lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but TITLE collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit EOS	350.54
SOS it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction EOS	58.72
SOS but i will no longer importune my young cousin EOS	2747.15
SOS then turning to TITLE bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon EOS	4.06
SOS TITLE bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements EOS	45.37
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but TITLE collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with TITLE bennet and prepared for backgammon EOS	335.71
SOS TITLE collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance EOS	34.09
SOS the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity EOS	5.12
SOS a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility EOS	1.03
SOS having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report EOS	29.63
SOS this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part EOS	3561.29
SOS his plan did not vary on seeing them EOS	8.57
SOS miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice EOS	83.18
SOS the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s tête à tête with TITLE bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on EOS	1.60
SOS as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged EOS	29.55
SOS TITLE collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while TITLE bennet was stirring the fire EOS	1.53
SOS elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course EOS	630.14
SOS TITLE bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces EOS	159.21
SOS lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and TITLE collins was to attend them at the request of TITLE bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither TITLE collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to TITLE bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford EOS	21.97
SOS such doings discomposed TITLE bennet exceedingly EOS	84.35
SOS in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting TITLE collins to join his daughters in their walk and TITLE collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go EOS	74.24
SOS in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton EOS	70.56
SOS the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him EOS	4.07
SOS their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them EOS	69.44
SOS but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way EOS	28.82
SOS the officer was the very TITLE denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed EOS	45970.05
SOS all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot EOS	9.97
SOS TITLE denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend TITLE wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps EOS	568.19
SOS this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming EOS	135.32
SOS his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address EOS	1.84
SOS the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street EOS	83.26
SOS on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities EOS	4.37
SOS bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object EOS	158.17
SOS he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her EOS	101111.80
SOS TITLE darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting EOS	194.91
SOS both changed colour one looked white the other red EOS	2.79
SOS TITLE wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which TITLE darcy just deigned to return EOS	14.86
SOS what could be the meaning of it EOS	57.77
SOS it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know EOS	308.48
SOS in another minute TITLE bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend EOS	12.80
SOS TITLE denny and TITLE wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of TITLE philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of TITLE philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation EOS	18.02
SOS TITLE philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see TITLE jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards TITLE collins by jane s introduction of him EOS	32.06
SOS she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice EOS	21.43
SOS TITLE philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that TITLE denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire EOS	4959.41
SOS she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had TITLE wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows EOS	57.77
SOS some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on TITLE wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening EOS	4.50
SOS this was agreed to and TITLE philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards EOS	5.59
SOS the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits EOS	64.91
SOS TITLE collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless EOS	93.87
SOS as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister EOS	12042.83
SOS TITLE collins on his return highly gratified TITLE bennet by admiring TITLE philips s manners and politeness EOS	691.79
SOS he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before EOS	1.94
SOS something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life EOS	7027.20
SOS as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all TITLE collins s scruples of leaving TITLE and TITLE bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that TITLE wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house EOS	1252.68
SOS when this information was given and they had all taken their seats TITLE collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when TITLE philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room EOS	13.47
SOS in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in TITLE philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could EOS	100.46
SOS to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long EOS	30.00
SOS it was over at last however EOS	313.15
SOS the gentlemen did approach and when TITLE wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration EOS	5.27
SOS the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but TITLE wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room EOS	63.97
SOS TITLE wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker EOS	4.40
SOS with such rivals for the notice of the fair as TITLE wickham and the officers TITLE collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in TITLE philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin EOS	4.76
SOS when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist EOS	172.87
SOS i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life TITLE philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason EOS	13.81
SOS TITLE wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia EOS	17.19
SOS at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular EOS	11.94
SOS allowing for the common demands of the game TITLE wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with TITLE darcy EOS	946.52
SOS she dared not even mention that gentleman EOS	90.36
SOS her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved EOS	52.10
SOS TITLE wickham began the subject himself EOS	2.51
SOS he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long TITLE darcy had been staying there EOS	20940.31
SOS about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand EOS	280.74
SOS yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one EOS	19.20
SOS a clear ten thousand per annum EOS	88.36
SOS you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy EOS	307.88
SOS elizabeth could not but look surprised EOS	249.35
SOS you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday EOS	52.30
SOS are you much acquainted with TITLE darcy EOS	45.62
SOS as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable EOS	499.65
SOS i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise EOS	27.89
SOS i am not qualified to form one EOS	2.75
SOS i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge EOS	246.31
SOS it is impossible for me to be impartial EOS	15.70
SOS but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else EOS	7.00
SOS here you are in your own family EOS	71310.10
SOS upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield EOS	1.53
SOS he is not at all liked in hertfordshire EOS	3162.15
SOS every body is disgusted with his pride EOS	18.90
SOS you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one EOS	57.93
SOS i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen EOS	178.06
SOS the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen EOS	11746.62
SOS i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man EOS	3.15

SOS i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield EOS	12.81
SOS i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood EOS	59.52
SOS oh EOS	11.58
SOS no it is not for me to be driven away by TITLE darcy EOS	377.28
SOS if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go EOS	2251.48
SOS we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is EOS	480.61
SOS his father miss bennet the late TITLE darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this TITLE darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections EOS	70.50
SOS his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father EOS	150.12
SOS elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry EOS	21.31
SOS TITLE wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry EOS	2.43
SOS it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire EOS	7.84
SOS i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them EOS	624.57
SOS society i own is necessary to me EOS	164.86
SOS i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude EOS	108.44
SOS i must have employment and society EOS	9.50
SOS a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible EOS	4.57
SOS the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now EOS	8.85
SOS indeed EOS	116.61
SOS yes the late TITLE darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift EOS	4.64
SOS he was my godfather and excessively attached to me EOS	105.71
SOS i cannot do justice to his kindness EOS	1.12
SOS he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere EOS	3338.10
SOS good heavens EOS	8.39
SOS cried elizabeth but how could that be EOS	33.59
SOS how could his will be disregarded EOS	136.09
SOS why did not you seek legal redress EOS	11.17
SOS there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law EOS	154.30
SOS a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but TITLE darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing EOS	100993.74
SOS certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it EOS	3772.98
SOS i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely EOS	16.24
SOS i can recal nothing worse EOS	22551.75
SOS but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me EOS	3.03
SOS this is quite shocking EOS	131746.05
SOS he deserves to be publicly disgraced EOS	82.92
SOS some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me EOS	131.23
SOS till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him EOS	14341.85
SOS elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them EOS	32.39
SOS but what said she after a pause can have been his motive EOS	9.88
SOS what can have induced him to behave so cruelly EOS	29.62
SOS a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy EOS	69.37
SOS had the late TITLE darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life EOS	7992.07
SOS he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me EOS	118.90
SOS i had not thought TITLE darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this EOS	26.60
SOS after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper EOS	27993.38
SOS his disposition must be dreadful EOS	29.76
SOS i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him EOS	30.72
SOS elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father EOS	70.94
SOS she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner EOS	27.12
SOS we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care EOS	5628.41
SOS my father began life in the profession which your uncle TITLE philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late TITLE darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property EOS	16226.74
SOS he was most highly esteemed by TITLE darcy a most intimate confidential friend EOS	156680.30
SOS TITLE darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death TITLE darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself EOS	559.65
SOS how strange EOS	24.31
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	28.96
SOS how abominable EOS	2105.39
SOS i wonder that the very pride of this TITLE darcy has not made him just to you EOS	245.57
SOS if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it EOS	9.42
SOS it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend EOS	30.42
SOS it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling EOS	2356.57
SOS but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride EOS	3198.33
SOS can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good EOS	174.76
SOS yes EOS	10.20
SOS it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor EOS	2.34
SOS family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this EOS	10.96
SOS not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive EOS	230.02
SOS he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers EOS	52.14
SOS what sort of a girl is miss darcy EOS	34448.07
SOS he shook his head EOS	80.83
SOS i wish i could call her amiable EOS	26.91
SOS it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy EOS	130.53
SOS but she is too much like her brother very very proud EOS	6.81
SOS as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement EOS	127.11
SOS but she is nothing to me now EOS	1.84
SOS she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished EOS	15.27
SOS since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education EOS	16.43
SOS after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with TITLE bingley EOS	38.65
SOS how can TITLE bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man EOS	19.11
SOS how can they suit each other EOS	73.38
SOS do you know TITLE bingley EOS	2.42
SOS not at all EOS	22.43
SOS he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man EOS	7690.72
SOS he cannot know what TITLE darcy is EOS	3.53
SOS probably not but TITLE darcy can please where he chuses EOS	81.61
SOS he does not want abilities EOS	380.54
SOS he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while EOS	549.75
SOS among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous EOS	131.35
SOS his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure EOS	404.63
SOS the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and TITLE collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and TITLE philips EOS	5.05
SOS the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter EOS	39.02
SOS it had not been very great he had lost every point but when TITLE philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy EOS	16.10
SOS i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object EOS	33250.44
SOS there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters EOS	53.46
SOS TITLE wickham s attention was caught and after observing TITLE collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh EOS	42.89
SOS lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living EOS	3272.76
SOS i hardly know how TITLE collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long EOS	102.97
SOS you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present TITLE darcy EOS	2535.88
SOS no indeed i did not EOS	119.71
SOS i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections EOS	3.82
SOS i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday EOS	174.03
SOS her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates EOS	239.39
SOS this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley EOS	15.85
SOS vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another EOS	3.58
SOS TITLE collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman EOS	4.76
SOS i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent EOS	7.47
SOS she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class EOS	82.84
SOS elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of TITLE wickham s attentions EOS	19.46
SOS there could be no conversation in the noise of TITLE philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body EOS	1321.08
SOS whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully EOS	31.72
SOS elizabeth went away with her head full of him EOS	131.20
SOS she could think of nothing but of TITLE wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor TITLE collins were once silent EOS	11.41
SOS lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and TITLE collins in describing the civility of TITLE and TITLE philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house EOS	23.98
SOS elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between TITLE wickham and herself EOS	19.02
SOS jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that TITLE darcy could be so unworthy of TITLE bingley s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham EOS	184306.83
SOS the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained EOS	137.79
SOS they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea EOS	1205.56
SOS interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other EOS	21.79
SOS it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side EOS	169.10
SOS very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business EOS	5.58
SOS do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody EOS	8.39
SOS laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion EOS	57.75
SOS my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places TITLE darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for EOS	10.74
SOS it is impossible EOS	14.94
SOS no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it EOS	223.58
SOS can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him EOS	282.66
SOS oh EOS	7.56
SOS no EOS	14.86
SOS i can much more easily believe TITLE bingley s being imposed on than that TITLE wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony EOS	1536.62
SOS if it be not so let TITLE darcy contradict it EOS	158.64
SOS besides there was truth in his looks EOS	8306.07
SOS it is difficult indeed it is distressing EOS	2013.33
SOS one does not know what to think EOS	4.99
SOS i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think EOS	287.12
SOS but jane could think with certainty on only one point that TITLE bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public EOS	33.25
SOS the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking TITLE bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday EOS	8.79
SOS the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation EOS	84570.01
SOS to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding TITLE bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others EOS	3150.88
SOS they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from TITLE bennet s civilities EOS	85.08
SOS the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family EOS	90155.59
SOS TITLE bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from TITLE bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card EOS	18.18
SOS jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with TITLE wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in TITLE darcy s looks and behaviour EOS	29.30
SOS the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with TITLE wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball EOS	41.56
SOS and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it EOS	152.42
SOS while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough EOS	231.90
SOS i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements EOS	469.01
SOS society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body EOS	15127.41
SOS elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to TITLE collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept TITLE bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance EOS	53.49
SOS i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her EOS	8.89
SOS elizabeth felt herself completely taken in EOS	287.12
SOS she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have TITLE collins instead EOS	378.33
SOS her liveliness had been never worse timed EOS	16.56
SOS there was no help for it however EOS	128.22
SOS TITLE wickham s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and TITLE collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could EOS	3909.50
SOS she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more EOS	9.57
SOS it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors EOS	6.44
SOS the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her EOS	251.06
SOS elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply EOS	114.78
SOS TITLE collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him EOS	276.26
SOS if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once EOS	56388.72
SOS no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy EOS	96.51
SOS even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with TITLE wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia EOS	65.22
SOS till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for TITLE wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her EOS	38.86
SOS the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her EOS	213.59
SOS she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening EOS	93.60
SOS but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for TITLE darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend TITLE denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here EOS	188.22
SOS this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make EOS	966.97
SOS attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham EOS	39.40
SOS she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to TITLE bingley whose blind partiality provoked her EOS	38.65
SOS but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice EOS	21995.17
SOS the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification EOS	9.31
SOS TITLE collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give EOS	6466.91
SOS the moment of her release from him was ecstacy EOS	6.21
SOS she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked EOS	58.28
SOS when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by TITLE darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him EOS	38.65
SOS he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her EOS	1734.42
SOS i dare say you will find him very agreeable EOS	10.13
SOS heaven forbid EOS	332.82
SOS that would be the greatest misfortune of all EOS	43.37
SOS to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate EOS	18.78
SOS do not wish me such an evil EOS	6897.41
SOS when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence EOS	1344.31
SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	5.47
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	22.88
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	925.54
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	17635.65
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	182778.22
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	1164.76
SOS very well EOS	602.74
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	39.09
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	184.12
SOS but now we may be silent EOS	15204.43
SOS do you talk by rule then while you are dancing EOS	10.63
SOS sometimes EOS	9407.54
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	22.34
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	11.70
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	102.27
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	130.61
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	6067.38
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	219.75
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	2205.66
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	45.23
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	249.67
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	9.38
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	3420.23
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	675.19
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	4.67
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	144.20
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	50.28
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	45384.25
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	1863.00
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	277.02
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	127.80
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	4.94
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	61.56
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	18.87
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	5343.98
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	2540.90
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	242.61
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	43.44
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	58.53
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	28963.93
SOS we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine EOS	831344.31
SOS what think you of books EOS	34117.31
SOS said he smiling EOS	66.91
SOS books oh EOS	36.91
SOS no EOS	651.49
SOS i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings EOS	10.59
SOS i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject EOS	30.55
SOS we may compare our different opinions EOS	30.89
SOS no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else EOS	1730.50
SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	61.79
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	48.79
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	14.60
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	12.59
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	212.93
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	500.31
SOS i hope not EOS	55.15
SOS it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first EOS	93.12
SOS may i ask to what these questions tend EOS	61.51
SOS merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity EOS	53.98
SOS i am trying to make it out EOS	223.56
SOS and what is your success EOS	152.91
SOS she shook her head EOS	13.87
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	20.04
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	123.42
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	17764.88
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	115.65
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	4.77
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	10.80
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	123.83
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	11.52
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	4.09
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	84.82
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	120.22
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	15.53
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	31.08
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	29.55
SOS excuse my interference EOS	3266.76
SOS it was kindly meant EOS	545.03
SOS insolent girl EOS	152.60
SOS said elizabeth to herself EOS	131.56
SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	4157.88
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	434.14
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	1006.99
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	8.33
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	6.60
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	222.50
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	514.45
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	815.21
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	49.43
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	89.39
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	74557.94
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	122.42
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	17.04
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	11.63
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	35.29
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	974.34
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	24.14
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	8.57
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	9.61
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	10106.37
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	4.42
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	11.44
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	12925.26
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	2.24
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	4.32
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	7511.69
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	20806.42
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	2062.58
SOS indeed i am EOS	1.28
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	206.51
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	1.03
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	111661.38
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	368.29
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	1649.70
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	389.35
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	2.17
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	1.04
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	449.46
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	32.28
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	5.11
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	16.28
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	2379.36
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	61331.96
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	28.44
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	8.28
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	414.21
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	41862.36
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	27.77
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	40.97
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	17.83
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	7550.48
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	94.94
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	35.41
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	258.01
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	1.91
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	249.02
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	4598.54
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	2227.05
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	1.11
SOS i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear EOS	312.73
SOS for heaven s sake madam speak lower EOS	1345.77
SOS what advantage can it be to you to offend TITLE darcy EOS	51.33
SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	5064.00
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	30794.74
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	3142.68
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	18.65
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	804.30
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	12.53
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	1819.79
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	2598.67
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	38720.08
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	1.65
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	10113.11
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	4517.27
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	7.48
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	11.28
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	16.28
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	5596.35
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	269.69
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	64.10
SOS let the other young ladies have time to exhibit EOS	89.44
SOS mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good EOS	9.13
SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	305.51
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	37.09
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	36842.32
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	3.47
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	136.67
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	31.86
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	631.72
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	7114.00
SOS and with a bow to TITLE darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room EOS	26.34
SOS many stared EOS	263.84
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	9.03
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	669.04
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	223.13
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	9.33
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	1234.98
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	61.73
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	26184.88
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	55.68
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	22365.70
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	1.63
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	7562.97
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	89.12
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	69.77
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	55280.55
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	2432.50
SOS TITLE bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene EOS	16.70
SOS TITLE bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other EOS	336.39
SOS elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either TITLE hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am EOS	1.12
SOS accompanied by a violent yawn EOS	53.23
SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	4842.24
SOS bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time EOS	24.78
SOS TITLE bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months EOS	193.31
SOS of having another daughter married to TITLE collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure EOS	60.02
SOS elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by TITLE bingley and netherfield EOS	3247.24
SOS the next day opened a new scene at longbourn EOS	210.49
SOS TITLE collins made his declaration in form EOS	1663.56
SOS having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business EOS	18.21
SOS on finding TITLE bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning EOS	25.93
SOS before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise TITLE bennet instantly answered oh dear EOS	38.60
SOS yes certainly EOS	741.67
SOS i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection EOS	26.04
SOS come kitty i want you up stairs EOS	63.15
SOS and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go EOS	531.35
SOS i beg you will not go EOS	35.54
SOS TITLE collins must excuse me EOS	16455.73
SOS he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear EOS	5376.03
SOS i am going away myself EOS	120.77
SOS no no nonsense lizzy EOS	8.61
SOS i desire you will stay where you are EOS	31.25
SOS and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing TITLE collins EOS	21.47
SOS elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion EOS	701.43
SOS TITLE bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone TITLE collins began EOS	2.67
SOS believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections EOS	43.18
SOS you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address EOS	21.77
SOS you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken EOS	12097.97
SOS almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life EOS	227.12
SOS but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did EOS	6.06
SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	927.53
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	1.15
SOS twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too EOS	243.20
SOS on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while TITLE jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said TITLE collins you must marry EOS	1196.43
SOS a clergyman like you must marry EOS	401.17
SOS chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way EOS	2.54
SOS this is my advice EOS	10511.04
SOS find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her EOS	57104.30
SOS allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer EOS	104.85
SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	81.78
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	1.46
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	14.06
SOS this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem EOS	596.16
SOS and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection EOS	35601.82
SOS to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents EOS	19.81
SOS which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to EOS	48.59
SOS on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married EOS	164484.95
SOS it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now EOS	24.17
SOS you are too hasty sir she cried EOS	142646.66
SOS you forget that i have made no answer EOS	100149.42
SOS let me do it without farther loss of time EOS	56137.55
SOS accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me EOS	2.11
SOS i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them EOS	14.86
SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	57.31
SOS i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long EOS	7.78
SOS upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration EOS	1487.39
SOS i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time EOS	378.46
SOS i am perfectly serious in my refusal EOS	30765.33
SOS you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so EOS	244.62
SOS nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation EOS	845.71
SOS were it certain that lady catherine would think so said TITLE collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you EOS	152.02
SOS and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications EOS	27.59
SOS indeed TITLE collins all praise of me will be unnecessary EOS	1.10
SOS you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say EOS	90.32
SOS i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise EOS	1157.70
SOS in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach EOS	38039.41
SOS this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled EOS	380.98
SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	20.36
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	57765.70
SOS if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one EOS	5427.14
SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	12.78
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	31838.06
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	18.79
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	57.97
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	63.81
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	19.05
SOS i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere EOS	1.17
SOS i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible EOS	8.18
SOS my feelings in every respect forbid it EOS	944.06
SOS can i speak plainer EOS	6.09
SOS do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart EOS	96.57
SOS you are uniformly charming EOS	14.22
SOS cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable EOS	28193.97
SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	13.42
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	18.50
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	53.41
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	2121.92
SOS but depend upon it TITLE collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason EOS	65.29
SOS i will speak to her about it myself directly EOS	54397.10
SOS she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it EOS	40.96
SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	668.76
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	19.38
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	114831.19
SOS lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these EOS	6.08
SOS in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived EOS	82.52
SOS i will go directly to TITLE bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure EOS	3.57
SOS she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh EOS	59.61
SOS TITLE bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar EOS	2.65
SOS you must come and make lizzy marry TITLE collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her EOS	56.00
SOS TITLE bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication EOS	146.05
SOS i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech EOS	7.92
SOS of what are you talking EOS	382.30
SOS of TITLE collins and lizzy EOS	121.88
SOS lizzy declares she will not have TITLE collins and TITLE collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy EOS	269.49
SOS and what am i to do on the occasion EOS	104.35
SOS it seems an hopeless business EOS	15.55
SOS speak to lizzy about it yourself EOS	64.64
SOS tell her that you insist upon her marrying him EOS	83409.40
SOS let her be called down EOS	157.06
SOS she shall hear my opinion EOS	121.75
SOS TITLE bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library EOS	1924.51
SOS come here child cried her father as she appeared EOS	1.33
SOS i have sent for you on an affair of importance EOS	2779.12
SOS i understand that TITLE collins has made you an offer of marriage EOS	227.41
SOS is it true EOS	66.17
SOS elizabeth replied that it was EOS	13.06
SOS very well and this offer of marriage you have refused EOS	165.98
SOS i have sir EOS	218.31
SOS very well EOS	18116.11
SOS we now come to the point EOS	21055.12
SOS your mother insists upon your accepting it EOS	3.53
SOS is not it so TITLE bennet EOS	594.97
SOS yes or i will never see her again EOS	4117.61
SOS an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth EOS	156.61
SOS from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents EOS	33.56
SOS your mother will never see you again if you do not marry TITLE collins and i will never see you again if you do EOS	7.33
SOS elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but TITLE bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed EOS	4005.61
SOS what do you mean TITLE bennet by talking in this way EOS	1288.11
SOS you promised me to insist upon her marrying him EOS	62.68
SOS my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request EOS	179.61
SOS first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room EOS	136.48
SOS i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be EOS	141.63
SOS not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did TITLE bennet give up the point EOS	1188.28
SOS she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns EOS	15.17
SOS she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks EOS	7650.90
SOS though her manner varied however her determination never did EOS	4.29
SOS TITLE collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed EOS	73706.95
SOS he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way EOS	20874.49
SOS his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret EOS	348.09
SOS while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them EOS	30.51
SOS she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here EOS	65.43
SOS what do you think has happened this morning EOS	157.29
SOS TITLE collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him EOS	711.43
SOS charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where TITLE bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family EOS	3.78
SOS pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves EOS	943.69
SOS charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth EOS	85.59
SOS aye there she comes continued TITLE bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way EOS	148.24
SOS but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead EOS	1.07
SOS i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you EOS	74.17
SOS i have done with you from this very day EOS	882.78
SOS i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word EOS	10.56
SOS i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children EOS	150158.69
SOS not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body EOS	21.51
SOS people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking EOS	36.95
SOS nobody can tell what i suffer EOS	91898.69
SOS but it is always so EOS	9041.40
SOS those who do not complain are never pitied EOS	167.68
SOS her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation EOS	90.81
SOS she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by TITLE collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let TITLE collins and me have a little conversation together EOS	65513.51
SOS elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of TITLE collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear EOS	154038.05
SOS in a doleful voice TITLE bennet thus began the projected conversation EOS	80.53
SOS oh EOS	156.79
SOS TITLE collins EOS	184.14
SOS my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point EOS	18489.63
SOS far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter EOS	47.23
SOS resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned EOS	1218.33
SOS perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation EOS	8.53
SOS you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and TITLE bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf EOS	290.41
SOS my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own EOS	44.65
SOS but we are all liable to error EOS	29284.76
SOS i have certainly meant well through the whole affair EOS	1.98
SOS my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise EOS	3.87
SOS the discussion of TITLE collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother EOS	36.65
SOS as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence EOS	4.00
SOS he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend EOS	14.86
SOS the morrow produced no abatement of TITLE bennet s ill humour or ill health EOS	64849.19
SOS TITLE collins was also in the same state of angry pride EOS	419.34
SOS elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it EOS	25.00
SOS he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay EOS	307.59
SOS after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if TITLE wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball EOS	69.44
SOS he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over EOS	470133.47
SOS to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed EOS	24.04
SOS i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet TITLE darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself EOS	57.10
SOS she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her EOS	1148.03
SOS his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother EOS	21.39
SOS soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately EOS	23097.37
SOS the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages EOS	174.26
SOS jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs EOS	53628.37
SOS when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal EOS	4.75
SOS the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again EOS	31.03
SOS you shall hear what she says EOS	11763.14
SOS she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where TITLE hurst had a house EOS	11203.14
SOS the next was in these words EOS	1484.50
SOS i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence EOS	14.31
SOS i depend on you for that EOS	57.28
SOS to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent TITLE bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his EOS	21121.52
SOS it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country EOS	864.80
SOS but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters EOS	33.56
SOS TITLE bingley will not be detained in london by them EOS	1225.88
SOS caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter EOS	3165.09
SOS i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel EOS	17.24
SOS many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair EOS	161.46
SOS i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you EOS	340.25
SOS it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter EOS	28948.99
SOS it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should EOS	33912.45
SOS why will you think so EOS	13266.70
SOS it must be his own doing EOS	683.13
SOS he is his own master EOS	10.65
SOS but you do not know all EOS	2.34
SOS i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me EOS	57.42
SOS i will have no reserves from you EOS	49.08
SOS TITLE darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again EOS	592.63
SOS i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister EOS	478.63
SOS i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable EOS	25.31
SOS my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart EOS	60.61
SOS with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many EOS	8.10
SOS what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy EOS	42.71
SOS said jane as she finished it EOS	653.92
SOS is it not clear enough EOS	12.23
SOS does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly EOS	3.76
SOS to put me on my guard EOS	77.06
SOS can there be any other opinion on the subject EOS	74.08
SOS yes there can for mine is totally different EOS	2356.57
SOS will you hear it EOS	8.37
SOS most willingly EOS	32488.06
SOS you shall have it in few words EOS	3945.60
