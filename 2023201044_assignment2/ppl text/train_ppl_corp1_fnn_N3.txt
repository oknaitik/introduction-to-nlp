SOS miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy EOS	251.42
SOS she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you EOS	5.20
SOS jane shook her head EOS	37606.96
SOS indeed jane you ought to believe me EOS	63.30
SOS no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection EOS	46.06
SOS miss bingley i am sure cannot EOS	48.21
SOS she is not such a simpleton EOS	31.03
SOS could she have seen half as much love in TITLE darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes EOS	18.96
SOS but the case is this EOS	30.05
SOS we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way EOS	2.44
SOS but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend EOS	6.35
SOS if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy EOS	6.79
SOS but i know the foundation is unjust EOS	5050.54
SOS caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself EOS	12.43
SOS that is right EOS	3.58
SOS you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine EOS	123.85
SOS believe her to be deceived by all means EOS	69.71
SOS you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer EOS	3.34
SOS but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere EOS	9.00
SOS you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him EOS	22.19
SOS how can you talk so EOS	6200.33
SOS said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate EOS	19.29
SOS i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion EOS	19.69
SOS but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required EOS	111.06
SOS a thousand things may arise in six months EOS	69.52
SOS the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt EOS	3.99
SOS it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one EOS	1240.86
SOS she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect EOS	1.25
SOS jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart EOS	1143.62
SOS they agreed that TITLE bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together EOS	19.25
SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	198.76
SOS the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to TITLE collins EOS	16.53
SOS elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her EOS	28672.94
SOS it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express EOS	10.93
SOS charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time EOS	50.56
SOS this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of TITLE collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself EOS	15.38
SOS such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon EOS	7.56
SOS but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet EOS	20.62
SOS he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday EOS	148.61
SOS his reception however was of the most flattering kind EOS	1.63
SOS miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane EOS	69.86
SOS but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there EOS	7.97
SOS in as short a time as TITLE collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness EOS	14.89
SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	8.10
SOS sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity EOS	246.31
SOS TITLE collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair EOS	634.92
SOS lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer TITLE bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever TITLE collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st EOS	3.21
SOS james s EOS	2.88
SOS the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion EOS	1.70
SOS the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid EOS	421.14
SOS charlotte herself was tolerably composed EOS	156.34
SOS she had gained her point and had time to consider of it EOS	154.10
SOS her reflections were in general satisfactory EOS	61.30
SOS TITLE collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary EOS	2.19
SOS but still he would be her husband EOS	117.84
SOS without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want EOS	29.23
SOS this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it EOS	13.75
SOS the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person EOS	174.03
SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	23.17
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	156.68
SOS a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love EOS	23.74
SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	37.71
SOS my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible EOS	23.95
SOS they were all astonished and TITLE bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir EOS	8.03
SOS you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness EOS	279.58
SOS my dear sir replied TITLE collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence EOS	557.95
SOS you cannot be too much on your guard EOS	2254.99
SOS risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence EOS	43.65
SOS believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire EOS	41.87
SOS as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth EOS	8.18
SOS with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return EOS	251.42
SOS TITLE bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him EOS	5.20
SOS she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion EOS	61.28
SOS but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away EOS	2.61
SOS miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before EOS	4.76
SOS the possibility of TITLE collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to TITLE collins EOS	5831.26
SOS my dear charlotte impossible EOS	288.46
SOS the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza EOS	22.19
SOS do you think it incredible that TITLE collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you EOS	18.41
SOS but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness EOS	34.69
SOS i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as TITLE collins was wishing to marry you EOS	111.00
SOS but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done EOS	1.48
SOS i am not romantic you know EOS	385.54
SOS i never was EOS	11.94
SOS i ask only a comfortable home and considering TITLE collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state EOS	614.33
SOS elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family EOS	17.77
SOS charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard EOS	4.32
SOS it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match EOS	34.83
SOS the strangeness of TITLE collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted EOS	590.05
SOS she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage EOS	44.90
SOS charlotte the wife of TITLE collins was a most humiliating picture EOS	11.30
SOS and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen EOS	243.77
SOS elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family EOS	13.00
SOS with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for TITLE bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord EOS	6.68
SOS sir william how can you tell such a story EOS	53.23
SOS do not you know that TITLE collins wants to marry lizzy EOS	139.92
SOS nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy EOS	82.07
SOS elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of TITLE collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london EOS	29.56
SOS TITLE bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent EOS	24.33
SOS in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that TITLE collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off EOS	1.63
SOS two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day EOS	1612.30
SOS nothing could console and nothing appease her EOS	16.92
SOS nor did that day wear out her resentment EOS	2045.48
SOS a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter EOS	1326.16
SOS TITLE bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter EOS	7.43
SOS jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable EOS	19.11
SOS kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for TITLE collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton EOS	27.17
SOS lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on TITLE bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though TITLE bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away EOS	1504.87
SOS between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again EOS	121.59
SOS her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return EOS	59.13
SOS jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again EOS	11.05
SOS the promised letter of thanks from TITLE collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family might have prompted EOS	88.10
SOS after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men EOS	22.01
SOS TITLE collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to TITLE bennet EOS	4.58
SOS on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband EOS	1222.26
SOS it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome EOS	9.12
SOS she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable EOS	20.84
SOS such were the gentle murmurs of TITLE bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of TITLE bingley s continued absence EOS	3188.40
SOS neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject EOS	196.50
SOS day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed TITLE bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood EOS	21.19
SOS even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away EOS	74.31
SOS unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring EOS	6.88
SOS the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment EOS	34.71
SOS as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to EOS	53.68
SOS but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used EOS	24.65
SOS it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity EOS	119.40
SOS TITLE collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction EOS	92.26
SOS he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company EOS	1.65
SOS the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed EOS	27.26
SOS TITLE bennet was really in a most pitiable state EOS	586.79
SOS the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of EOS	5.59
SOS the sight of miss lucas was odious to her EOS	143.95
SOS as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence EOS	15.12
SOS whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to TITLE collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as TITLE bennet were dead EOS	50.95
SOS she complained bitterly of all this to her husband EOS	224.25
SOS indeed TITLE bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it EOS	10.15
SOS my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts EOS	1721.66
SOS let us hope for better things EOS	37.97
SOS let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor EOS	189.19
SOS this was not very consoling to TITLE bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate EOS	76.93
SOS if it was not for the entail i should not mind it EOS	239.33
SOS what should not you mind EOS	3.71
SOS i should not mind any thing at all EOS	400.73
SOS let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility EOS	1974.43
SOS i never can be thankful TITLE bennet for any thing about the entail EOS	92.88
SOS how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of TITLE collins too EOS	141.42
SOS why should he have it more than anybody else EOS	2.86
SOS i leave it to yourself to determine said TITLE bennet EOS	3748.35
SOS miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt EOS	182.48
SOS the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country EOS	18.23
SOS hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort EOS	5040.08
SOS miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it EOS	86.89
SOS her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter EOS	101.77
SOS she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of TITLE darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture EOS	173.66
SOS elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation EOS	37.06
SOS her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others EOS	120.64
SOS to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit EOS	12.34
SOS that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations EOS	288.34
SOS had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself EOS	480.99
SOS it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing EOS	341.40
SOS she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded EOS	5.92
SOS a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on TITLE bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh EOS	113.83
SOS that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him EOS	18.60

SOS elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time TITLE bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them EOS	8.19
SOS TITLE bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity EOS	16.43
SOS her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day EOS	2.44
SOS TITLE bennet s best comfort was that TITLE bingley must be down again in the summer EOS	6.35
SOS TITLE bennet treated the matter differently EOS	158.86
SOS so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find EOS	20.85

SOS you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane EOS	2.44

SOS thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me EOS	33.51
SOS we must not all expect jane s good fortune EOS	92.27
SOS true said TITLE bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it EOS	22752.01
SOS TITLE wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family EOS	7.08
SOS they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve EOS	87.94
SOS the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on TITLE darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked TITLE darcy before they had known any thing of the matter EOS	2.74
SOS miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else TITLE darcy was condemned as the worst of men EOS	388.30
SOS after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity TITLE collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday EOS	10.76
SOS the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men EOS	154.17
SOS he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks EOS	1130.15
SOS on the following monday TITLE bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn EOS	2.20
SOS TITLE gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education EOS	98.55
SOS the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable EOS	5.08
SOS TITLE gardiner who was several years younger than TITLE bennet and TITLE philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces EOS	63.24
SOS between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard EOS	136.36
SOS they had frequently been staying with her in town EOS	13.71
SOS the first part of TITLE gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions EOS	78.02
SOS when this was done she had a less active part to play EOS	129.99
SOS it became her turn to listen EOS	4.93
SOS TITLE bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of EOS	19.11

SOS oh sister EOS	242.38

SOS he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him EOS	3.42
SOS the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever EOS	3585.50
SOS the lucases are very artful people indeed sister EOS	54.64
SOS they are all for what they can get EOS	924.36
SOS i am sorry to say it of them but so it is EOS	1.48
SOS it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else EOS	5916.87
SOS however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves EOS	12531.52
SOS TITLE gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation EOS	25.21
SOS when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject EOS	14.49
SOS it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she EOS	78.78
SOS i am sorry it went off EOS	37.29
SOS but these things happen so often EOS	11.35
SOS a young man such as you describe TITLE bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent EOS	16.67
SOS an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us EOS	37.92
SOS we do not suffer by accident EOS	125.22
SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	38.05
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	35.94
SOS it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment EOS	255.77
SOS pray how violent was TITLE bingley s love EOS	54.09
SOS i never saw a more promising inclination EOS	105.99
SOS he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her EOS	41.16
SOS every time they met it was more decided and remarkable EOS	70.94
SOS at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer EOS	2569.10
SOS could there be finer symptoms EOS	105.56
SOS is not general incivility the very essence of love EOS	9.54
SOS oh yes EOS	82.57
SOS of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt EOS	11.54
SOS poor jane EOS	276.91
SOS i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately EOS	4.02
SOS it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner EOS	24.78
SOS but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us EOS	253.21
SOS change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything EOS	4.68
SOS elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence EOS	2.47
SOS i hope added TITLE gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her EOS	4668.90
SOS we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her EOS	27.46
SOS and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and TITLE darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london EOS	94.44
SOS my dear aunt how could you think of it EOS	412.84
SOS TITLE darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it TITLE bingley never stirs without him EOS	1710.71
SOS so much the better EOS	933.41
SOS i hope they will not meet at all EOS	11.44
SOS but does not jane correspond with the sister EOS	54.07
SOS she will not be able to help calling EOS	8.61
SOS she will drop the acquaintance entirely EOS	73.54
SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	318.23
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	33.12
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	1353.17
SOS the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement EOS	1.84
SOS TITLE bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner EOS	10381.80
SOS when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers TITLE wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions TITLE gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both EOS	32.66
SOS without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment EOS	4.32
SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	4.16
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	363.07
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	3.83
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	68.92
SOS here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse EOS	52.37
SOS in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself EOS	3.47
SOS on being made acquainted with the present TITLE darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard TITLE fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy EOS	24.78
SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	3.97
SOS seriously i would have you be on your guard EOS	147.78
SOS do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent EOS	28.57
SOS i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better EOS	182.71
SOS but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you EOS	270.35
SOS you have sense and we all expect you to use it EOS	281.96
SOS your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure EOS	9.01
SOS you must not disappoint your father EOS	9.12
SOS my dear aunt this is being serious indeed EOS	551.65
SOS yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise EOS	4012.64
SOS well then you need not be under any alarm EOS	366.92
SOS i will take care of myself and of TITLE wickham too EOS	21.27
SOS he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it EOS	10.71
SOS elizabeth you are not serious now EOS	19.11
SOS i beg your pardon EOS	32.88
SOS i will try again EOS	2.01
SOS at present i am not in love with TITLE wickham no i certainly am not EOS	7.93
SOS but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not EOS	238.63
SOS i see the imprudence of it EOS	113.25
SOS oh EOS	30.50
SOS that abominable TITLE darcy EOS	146.27
SOS my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it EOS	2303.73
SOS my father however is partial to TITLE wickham EOS	3669.57
SOS in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist EOS	19.38
SOS all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry EOS	51.38
SOS i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object EOS	124.97
SOS when i am in company with him i will not be wishing EOS	12987.97
SOS in short i will do my best EOS	44.50
SOS perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often EOS	16.57
SOS at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him EOS	48.31
SOS as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that EOS	20.36
SOS but do not imagine that he is always here so often EOS	8.98
SOS it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week EOS	493.92
SOS you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends EOS	31.45
SOS but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied EOS	21.57
SOS her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented EOS	2730.96
SOS TITLE collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to TITLE bennet EOS	86.80
SOS his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy EOS	5.52
SOS thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room EOS	123.85
SOS as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza EOS	11195.56
SOS that you certainly shall EOS	3.38
SOS and i have another favour to ask EOS	24.78
SOS will you come and see me EOS	20.30
SOS we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire EOS	7376.25
SOS i am not likely to leave kent for some time EOS	54.55
SOS promise me therefore to come to hunsford EOS	688.17
SOS elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit EOS	240.88
SOS my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party EOS	2.73
SOS indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them EOS	13.51
SOS the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual EOS	47.44
SOS elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible EOS	1208.05
SOS elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was EOS	8867.93
SOS charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen EOS	829.61
SOS she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise EOS	101.32
SOS the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging EOS	97.99
SOS it was TITLE collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest EOS	12.04
SOS jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys EOS	14.35
SOS her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is EOS	448.19
SOS jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline EOS	1.51
SOS she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost EOS	23.32
SOS my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street EOS	132.20
SOS she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley EOS	993.82
SOS i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london EOS	126.22
SOS i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her EOS	210.58
SOS i enquired after their brother of course EOS	32.21
SOS he was well but so much engaged with TITLE darcy that they scarcely ever saw him EOS	2.54
SOS i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner EOS	5071.64
SOS i wish i could see her EOS	9.87
SOS my visit was not long as caroline and TITLE hurst were going out EOS	11.53
SOS i dare say i shall soon see them here EOS	504.21
SOS elizabeth shook her head over this letter EOS	1.26
SOS it convinced her that accident only could discover to TITLE bingley her sister s being in town EOS	59.80
SOS four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him EOS	246.57
SOS she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention EOS	10.24
SOS after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer EOS	84.35
SOS the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt EOS	350.51
SOS my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me EOS	2.44
SOS but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion EOS	112.88
SOS i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again EOS	67.18
SOS caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time EOS	52.37
SOS when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer EOS	26.31
SOS i pity though i cannot help blaming her EOS	691.51
SOS she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side EOS	26.30
SOS but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it EOS	6.30
SOS i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable EOS	101.61
SOS i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago EOS	29.06
SOS he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy EOS	1.94
SOS i cannot understand it EOS	747.56
SOS if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this EOS	61.68
SOS but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt EOS	21.53
SOS let me hear from you very soon EOS	485.57
SOS miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty EOS	44.21
SOS we had better not mention it EOS	23239.15
SOS i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford EOS	774.22
SOS pray go to see them with sir william and maria EOS	59.13
SOS i am sure you will be very comfortable there EOS	28.59
SOS your s c EOS	77.81
SOS this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least EOS	5.88
SOS all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over EOS	400.21
SOS she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions EOS	15.02
SOS his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry TITLE darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away EOS	45.47
SOS TITLE gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself EOS	6.21
SOS his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else EOS	537.72
SOS elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain EOS	92.42
SOS her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it EOS	14.05
SOS the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence EOS	36.26
SOS nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy EOS	117.86
SOS all this was acknowledged to TITLE gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil EOS	194.00
SOS but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king EOS	55.59
SOS i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl EOS	3.58
SOS there can be no love in all this EOS	2734.85
SOS my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance EOS	9.22
SOS importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly EOS	14.86
SOS kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do EOS	88.72
SOS they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain EOS	1.28
SOS with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away EOS	42.17
SOS march was to take elizabeth to hunsford EOS	54.30
SOS she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty EOS	15.80
SOS absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of TITLE collins EOS	4827.98
SOS there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake EOS	92.54
SOS the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay EOS	2779.65
SOS every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch EOS	43.49
SOS she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter EOS	46.21
SOS the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be EOS	43.48
SOS the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter EOS	82.22
SOS the farewell between herself and TITLE wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more EOS	498.01
SOS his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing EOS	69.41
SOS her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable EOS	202.35
SOS sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise EOS	105.83
SOS elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long EOS	512.61
SOS he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information EOS	957.07
SOS it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon EOS	3.83
SOS as they drove to TITLE gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever EOS	19.11
SOS on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower EOS	73.38
SOS all was joy and kindness EOS	11.95
SOS the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres EOS	12879.71

SOS their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection EOS	12.41
SOS it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long EOS	5074.48
SOS TITLE gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance EOS	120.93
SOS TITLE gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well EOS	69.43
SOS but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king EOS	524.23
SOS i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary EOS	88.81
SOS pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive EOS	19.12
SOS where does discretion end and avarice begin EOS	2.96
SOS last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary EOS	784.65

SOS she is a very good kind of girl i believe EOS	99.47
SOS i know no harm of her EOS	380.10
SOS but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune EOS	304.63
SOS no why should he EOS	27.06
SOS if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor EOS	603.19
SOS but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event EOS	16.94
SOS a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe EOS	1238.66
SOS if she does not object to it why should we EOS	14.33
SOS her not objecting does not justify him EOS	5.38

SOS take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment EOS	80.07
SOS before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer EOS	2133.61
SOS we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said TITLE gardiner but perhaps to the lakes EOS	4.41
SOS no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful EOS	28.96

SOS let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers EOS	2431.98
SOS every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight EOS	2.47
SOS when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view EOS	24.02
SOS the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side EOS	19.60
SOS elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants EOS	4.41
SOS at length the parsonage was discernible EOS	443.37
SOS the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving EOS	9.10
SOS TITLE collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party EOS	6.26
SOS in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other EOS	21202.11
SOS TITLE collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received EOS	2.52
SOS she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family EOS	1202.18
SOS they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment EOS	693.65
SOS elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him EOS	627.88
SOS but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion EOS	2429.04
SOS when TITLE collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte EOS	353.52
SOS once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear EOS	2514.34
SOS after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london TITLE collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself EOS	3578.47
SOS to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible EOS	277.19
SOS here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind EOS	5098.81
SOS he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump EOS	11.97
SOS but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house EOS	75.70
SOS it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground EOS	2.42
SOS from his garden TITLE collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband s help EOS	89.07
SOS it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit EOS	942.45
SOS when TITLE collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten EOS	5631.25
SOS she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country EOS	1.28
SOS it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when TITLE collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her EOS	122.40
SOS she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over EOS	158.04
SOS i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here EOS	17.97

SOS lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour EOS	7.89
SOS very true my dear that is exactly what i say EOS	53.09
SOS she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference EOS	3100.33
SOS the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well EOS	1.77
SOS she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of TITLE collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings EOS	203.46
SOS a lively imagination soon settled it all EOS	225.85
SOS about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her EOS	22.94
SOS she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza EOS	43.95
SOS pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen EOS	69.04
SOS i will not tell you what it is EOS	5.08
SOS make haste and come down this moment EOS	6.60
SOS elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate EOS	7.43
SOS and is this all EOS	38.64
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	362.17
SOS i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter EOS	2696.50

SOS only look at her EOS	156.00
SOS she is quite a little creature EOS	390.65
SOS who would have thought she could be so thin and small EOS	3.75
SOS she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind EOS	246.31
SOS why does she not come in EOS	9.84
SOS oh EOS	501.59
SOS charlotte says she hardly ever does EOS	16.29
SOS it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in EOS	15.19

SOS she looks sickly and cross EOS	20.08
SOS yes she will do for him very well EOS	34.32
SOS she will make him a very proper wife EOS	4.85
SOS TITLE collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way EOS	3973.15
SOS at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house EOS	249.53
SOS TITLE collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day EOS	2.66
SOS TITLE collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete EOS	772.36
SOS the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough EOS	213.86
SOS i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings EOS	20.55
SOS i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen EOS	1999.40
SOS but who could have foreseen such an attention as this EOS	1.69
SOS who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival EOS	633.79
SOS i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire EOS	2344.54
SOS about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon EOS	972.71
SOS scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings EOS	31.62
SOS TITLE collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them EOS	72.75
SOS when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel EOS	27.39
SOS lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter EOS	119.82
SOS i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more EOS	11.39
SOS lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed EOS	627.05
SOS she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved EOS	3.76
SOS while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner EOS	82.93
SOS such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st EOS	16.73
SOS james s EOS	21195.84
SOS as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park EOS	262.01
SOS every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as TITLE collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh EOS	272.10
SOS when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm EOS	1.23
SOS elizabeth s courage did not fail her EOS	144.40
SOS she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation EOS	87.75
SOS from the entrance hall of which TITLE collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and TITLE jenkinson were sitting EOS	5.70
SOS her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as TITLE collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her s it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary EOS	59.52
SOS in spite of having been at st EOS	849.31
SOS james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look EOS	19.14
SOS elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly EOS	10.20
SOS lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome EOS	4.37
SOS her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank EOS	343.12
SOS she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought TITLE wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented EOS	244.04
SOS when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of TITLE darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small EOS	109.32
SOS there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies EOS	17.01
SOS miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to TITLE jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes EOS	6.56
SOS after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view TITLE collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer EOS	1229.49
SOS the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which TITLE collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater EOS	1.73
SOS he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear EOS	2.79
SOS but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them EOS	14.49
SOS the party did not supply much conversation EOS	264.19
SOS elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time EOS	23.49
SOS TITLE jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed EOS	399.81
SOS maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire EOS	293.57
SOS when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted EOS	5.45
SOS she enquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her s and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry EOS	85.53
SOS elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others EOS	1.28
SOS in the intervals of her discourse with TITLE collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to TITLE collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl EOS	9.36
SOS she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name EOS	431.32
SOS elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly EOS	8.45
SOS lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on TITLE collins i think EOS	104.18
SOS for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line EOS	135.19

SOS who attended to you EOS	17.81
SOS without a governess you must have been neglected EOS	1.88

SOS pray what is your age EOS	19.06
SOS with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it EOS	6.87

SOS elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for TITLE collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement EOS	6.75
SOS from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to TITLE collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day EOS	49.05

SOS elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by TITLE collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty EOS	110.93
SOS the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first EOS	6.93

SOS this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors EOS	12.75
SOS her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity EOS	136.09
SOS in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away EOS	473.36
SOS easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important EOS	213.33
SOS elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that TITLE darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself EOS	8.91
SOS his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for TITLE collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence EOS	23.14
SOS on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects EOS	465.99
SOS there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for TITLE darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when TITLE collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him EOS	8.80
SOS charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility EOS	99.47
SOS TITLE darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me EOS	8.98
SOS elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room EOS	256.16
SOS colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman EOS	14.20
SOS TITLE darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to TITLE collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure EOS	9.59
SOS elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word EOS	21.58
SOS colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to TITLE collins sat for some time without speaking to any body EOS	14.17
SOS at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family EOS	1994.22
SOS she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months EOS	1568.50
SOS have you never happened to see her there EOS	5.57
SOS she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet EOS	84.07
SOS the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away EOS	1.09
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings EOS	5.23
SOS it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening EOS	36.65
SOS for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter EOS	19.47
SOS colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but TITLE darcy they had only seen at church EOS	875.94
SOS the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room EOS	7.25
SOS her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room EOS	196.65
SOS colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and TITLE collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much EOS	159.50
SOS he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of TITLE darcy EOS	12.23
SOS his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam EOS	4.46
SOS what is it you are talking of EOS	492.95
SOS what are you telling miss bennet EOS	3.15
SOS let me hear what it is EOS	28.63
SOS we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply EOS	42.17
SOS of music EOS	13.05
SOS then pray speak aloud EOS	15.20
SOS it is of all subjects my delight EOS	319.85
SOS i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music EOS	23.60
SOS there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste EOS	21.86
SOS if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient EOS	1.09
SOS and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply EOS	267.11
SOS i am confident that she would have performed delightfully EOS	10.08
SOS how does georgiana get on darcy EOS	6.44
SOS TITLE darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency EOS	28.96
SOS i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal EOS	9071.23
SOS i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice EOS	42.34
SOS she practises very constantly EOS	10.54
SOS so much the better EOS	280.61
SOS it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account EOS	1.16
SOS i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice EOS	190.52
SOS i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though TITLE collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in TITLE jenkinson s room EOS	10.41
SOS she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house EOS	7.18
SOS TITLE darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer EOS	42.03
SOS when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument EOS	4.40
SOS he drew a chair near her EOS	97.59
SOS lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance EOS	66.35
SOS elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me TITLE darcy by coming in all this state to hear me EOS	1.10
SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	64.56
SOS there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others EOS	878.06
SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	24.14
SOS i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own EOS	50.33
SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	2023.01
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	8.94
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	725.19
SOS i am not afraid of you said he smilingly EOS	1274.40
SOS pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam EOS	3.23
SOS i should like to know how he behaves among strangers EOS	808.95
SOS you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful EOS	226.99
SOS the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did EOS	15.73
SOS he danced only four dances EOS	1138.18
SOS i am sorry to pain you but so it was EOS	11.77
SOS he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner EOS	36.44
SOS TITLE darcy you cannot deny the fact EOS	1637.81
SOS i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party EOS	6.11
SOS true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room EOS	23.68
SOS well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next EOS	24.67
SOS my fingers wait your orders EOS	98768.12
SOS perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers EOS	11974.15
SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	29.54
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	34.54
SOS shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers EOS	5.45
SOS i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him EOS	925.09
SOS it is because he will not give himself the trouble EOS	266.71
SOS i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before EOS	5.59
SOS i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done EOS	16.21
SOS my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do EOS	600.17
SOS they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression EOS	4.86
SOS but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising EOS	133.16
SOS it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution EOS	5.11
SOS darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right EOS	24.09
SOS you have employed your time much better EOS	112.31
SOS no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting EOS	102.93
SOS we neither of us perform to strangers EOS	517.82
SOS here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of EOS	2.86
SOS elizabeth immediately began playing again EOS	203.93
SOS lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master EOS	57356.90
SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	1654.07
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	5.72
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	28.43
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	10.78
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	39.84
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	2582.09
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	1.52
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	148.88
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	1192.68
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	9.32
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	174.54
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	35.87
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	2.62
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	95.80
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	2095.07
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	19.45
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	24.78
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	102.31
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	577.85
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	3.37
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	33.37
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	23.20
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	8.66
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	559.54
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	197.32
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	3245.97
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	6.94
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	576.21
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	31.21
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	4.97
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	270.12
SOS and what is fifty miles of good road EOS	652.00
SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	367.79
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	7.25
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	9.46
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	2315.72
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	3.30
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	9640.76
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	16.86
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	109.81
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	1046.14
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	9.11
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	286.27
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	8.71
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	67.86
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	8.58
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	89.43
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	8.96
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	33.15
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	1.63
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	52.00
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	399.67
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	51.51
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	16.34
SOS all field sports were over EOS	4166.10
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	235.06
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	8.33
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	5.38
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	22.66
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	6.72
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	260.57
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	179.43
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	1115.72
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	150.37
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	6.82
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	98.38
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	4.59
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	19.11
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	758.47
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	51.66
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	59.37
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	55076.54
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	26.67
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	13.64
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	206.02
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	5.35
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	11464.50
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	8.14
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	15.40
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	97.97
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	122.82
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	43.82
SOS are you going much farther EOS	6169.28
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	57.42
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	5.27
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	1530.49
SOS said she EOS	36.67
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	4.83
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	43.21
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	731.24
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	41.63
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	16.44
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	2.11
SOS but so we all do EOS	53.21
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	1029.29
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	526.50
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	4.57
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	4707.31
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	2.69
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	1322.73
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	12.03
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	5.62
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	311.62
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	349.21
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	11.64
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	66.24
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	6691.96
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	4.10
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	42.71
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	5.70
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	372.51
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	1.63
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	82.55
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	5.17
SOS are you indeed EOS	1079.08
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	1.37
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	13.74
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	2556.40
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	61.60
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	11.54
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	272.14
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	16.61
SOS i think i have heard you say that you know them EOS	63.00
SOS i know them a little EOS	26.49
SOS their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s EOS	522.92
SOS oh EOS	7.84
SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	16327.25
SOS care of him EOS	136.18
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	67.86
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	4.52
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	1182.92
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	2.25
SOS what is it you mean EOS	1302.61
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	32.63
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	309.14
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	5.81
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	24.22
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	4.64
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	22.44
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	2130.79
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	1.15
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	10.05
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	53.23
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	1436.80
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	3715.46
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	156.97
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	335.53
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	860.89
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	58.01
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	4.01
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	169.50
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	3997.90
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	64.72
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	145.57
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	9862.30
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	298.71
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	932.85
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	6.70
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	213.87
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	1022.66
SOS to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection EOS	23.42
SOS all loveliness and goodness as she is EOS	849.66
SOS her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating EOS	46.49
SOS neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which TITLE darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach EOS	4.69
SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	837.54
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	1144.70
SOS TITLE collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but TITLE collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home EOS	104.58
SOS when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against TITLE darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent EOS	6.96
SOS they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering EOS	10752.64
SOS but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded EOS	5392.10
SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	1093.39
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	6.36
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	3098.97
SOS she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him EOS	8.39
SOS while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her EOS	710.70
SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	3.13
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	42.50
SOS she answered him with cold civility EOS	228.12
SOS he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room EOS	855.59
SOS elizabeth was surprised but said not a word EOS	6.68
SOS after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled EOS	449.14
SOS it will not do EOS	8.96
SOS my feelings will not be repressed EOS	208.29
SOS you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you EOS	921.04
SOS elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression EOS	109.82
SOS she stared coloured doubted and was silent EOS	5.55
SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	251.42
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	29.24
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	1190.52
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	24.58
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	17.38
SOS he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand EOS	169.12
SOS as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer EOS	381.86
SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	278.25
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	35.79
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	41.53
SOS but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly EOS	134.39
SOS i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one EOS	17.88
SOS it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration EOS	2.93
SOS the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation EOS	5.04
SOS TITLE darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise EOS	10.05
SOS his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature EOS	793.47
SOS he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it EOS	89.78
SOS the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful EOS	2.25
SOS at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting EOS	11.50
SOS i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected EOS	128.77
SOS but it is of small importance EOS	15.37
SOS i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character EOS	26562.96
SOS was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil EOS	10.84
SOS but i have other provocations EOS	13.57
SOS you know i have EOS	175.55
SOS had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister EOS	4.29
SOS as she pronounced these words TITLE darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued EOS	19.11
SOS i have every reason in the world to think ill of you EOS	680.62
SOS no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there EOS	204.29
SOS you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind EOS	52.52
SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	75.37
SOS he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity EOS	14.59
SOS can you deny that you have done it EOS	99.59
SOS she repeated EOS	8.62
SOS with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success EOS	738.22
SOS towards him i have been kinder than towards myself EOS	3.05
SOS elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her EOS	323.85
SOS but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded EOS	8.68
SOS long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided EOS	26240.10
SOS your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from TITLE wickham EOS	32616.71
SOS on this subject what can you have to say EOS	9.88
SOS in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself EOS	244.52
SOS or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others EOS	9.93
SOS you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour EOS	105.78
SOS who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him EOS	695.76
SOS his misfortunes EOS	431.34
SOS repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed EOS	5.41
SOS and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy EOS	46.59
SOS you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty EOS	23.41
SOS you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him EOS	14.93
SOS you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert EOS	12.22
SOS you have done all this EOS	8.66
SOS and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule EOS	195.58
SOS and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me EOS	1143.19
SOS this is the estimation in which you hold me EOS	189.59
SOS i thank you for explaining it so fully EOS	64.53
SOS my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed EOS	133.16
SOS but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design EOS	1.36
SOS these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing EOS	23.54
SOS but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence EOS	125.98
SOS nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related EOS	78.45
SOS they were natural and just EOS	2.00
SOS could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections EOS	37.62
SOS to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own EOS	36.30
SOS elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken TITLE darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	484.30
SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	1.33
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	88.84
SOS she went on EOS	12.48
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	46.29
SOS you have said quite enough madam EOS	11.99
SOS i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been EOS	49.98
SOS forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness EOS	2.81
SOS and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house EOS	13.72
SOS the tumult of her mind was now painfully great EOS	70.06
SOS she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour EOS	1718.03
SOS her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it EOS	8194.05
SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	7.70
SOS that he should have been in love with her for so many months EOS	4.25
SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	727.20
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	20.09
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	74.81
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	56.23
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	9.57
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	27.15
SOS she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of TITLE darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road EOS	22.22
SOS the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground EOS	12.16
SOS after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park EOS	24.69
SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	94.27
SOS she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being TITLE darcy she was directly retreating EOS	6.55
SOS but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name EOS	60.23
SOS she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be TITLE darcy she moved again towards the gate EOS	5.49
SOS he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you EOS	71.86
SOS will you do me the honour of reading that letter EOS	105.17
SOS and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight EOS	1.49
SOS with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand EOS	731.25
SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	217.23
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	2.64
SOS it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you EOS	3334.91
SOS i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read EOS	96.84
SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	5.56
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	32.96
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	197.42
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	145.57
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	253.11
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	153.41
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	115.85
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	8.13
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	1133.23
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	7.33
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	50.53
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	378.64
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	4.51
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	23.14
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	3560.34
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	345.56
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	166.77
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	23.09
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	4.79
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	12154.63
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	5.71
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	2762.29
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	149.83
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	4693.90
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	44.62
SOS pardon me EOS	2253.20
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	90.17
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	63.08
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	109.47
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	57.50
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	33.57
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	46.09
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	10.09
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	36.92
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	1499.74
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	13.29
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	273.70
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	156.83
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	2.83
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	157.76
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	15.85
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	16.66
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	859.00
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	15.54
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	47737.51
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	43.90
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	6.69
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	2393.57
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	34.17
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	3076.66
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	66.35
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	2.39
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	465.97
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	65.35
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	877.54
SOS but whatever may be the sentiments which TITLE wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character EOS	30.45
SOS it adds even another motive EOS	21.43
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	197.74
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	17.65
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	50787.68
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	73.94
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	2305.85
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	7.00
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	825.04
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	1.09
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	10.19
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	101.71
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	49.08
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	41.17
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	535.87
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	91.83
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	2.63
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	40.44
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	17.81
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	1033.22
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	9.87
SOS i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being EOS	77.43
SOS having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy EOS	2.32
SOS my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself EOS	6258.54
SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	25.13
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	9.88
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	137.48
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	971.17
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	3039.53
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	3.13
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	38.65
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	450.78
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	8.66
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	367.32
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	52.88
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	1530.83
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	47.83
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	12.67
SOS i will only add god bless you EOS	61.08
SOS fitzwilliam darcy EOS	62.20
SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	146.45
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	19.93
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	22.11
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	106.10
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	50.43
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	52.69
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	18.12
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	80.68
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	466.91
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	994.09
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	342.96
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	8.24
SOS this cannot be EOS	28.98
SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	1471.26
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	1.89
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	1368.00
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	2264.47
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	10.75
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	237.90
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	529.56
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	2.78
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	163.95
SOS again she read on EOS	61.07
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	92.78
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	99.50
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	3.44
SOS of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself EOS	25500.83
SOS as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring EOS	73.35
SOS his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue EOS	76.26
SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	268.66
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	5.89
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	4.69
SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	58.19
SOS but alas EOS	60.80
SOS the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question EOS	53.21
SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	526.32
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	184.00
SOS many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory EOS	685.58
SOS she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before EOS	25.04
SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	25.11
SOS she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing TITLE darcy that TITLE darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week EOS	142.51
SOS she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking TITLE darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son EOS	5.47
SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	8.14
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	8.85
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	290.04
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	1.99
SOS that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling EOS	211.89
SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	7.51
SOS she grew absolutely ashamed of herself EOS	128.58
SOS of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd EOS	1.03
SOS how despicably have i acted EOS	322.80
SOS she cried EOS	28.53
SOS i who have prided myself on my discernment EOS	41.83
SOS i who have valued myself on my abilities EOS	170.06
SOS who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust EOS	8541.80
SOS how humiliating is this discovery EOS	3083.32
SOS yet how just a humiliation EOS	20.22
SOS had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind EOS	2479.24
SOS but vanity not love has been my folly EOS	16.29
SOS pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned EOS	27.26
SOS till this moment i never knew myself EOS	211.93
SOS from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that TITLE darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again EOS	1.77
SOS widely different was the effect of a second perusal EOS	21.99
SOS how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other EOS	602.31
SOS he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been EOS	1.94
SOS neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane EOS	8.44
SOS she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility EOS	17.52
SOS when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe EOS	244.77
SOS the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers EOS	72.51
SOS the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt EOS	23.34
SOS it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before EOS	2.42
SOS after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation EOS	402.83
SOS she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence TITLE darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found EOS	92.69
SOS elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it EOS	24.65
SOS colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object EOS	6005.34
SOS she could think only of her letter EOS	54.71
SOS the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and TITLE collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings EOS	74.74
SOS to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her EOS	28.28
SOS elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been EOS	22.20
SOS what would she have said EOS	383.39
SOS how would she have behaved EOS	86.97
SOS were questions with which she amused herself EOS	97.98
SOS their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party EOS	40.46
SOS i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do EOS	23.73
SOS but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me EOS	95.30
SOS they were excessively sorry to go EOS	1.84
SOS but so they always are EOS	2869.57
SOS the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year EOS	1.56
SOS his attachment to rosings certainly increases EOS	3.91
SOS TITLE collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter EOS	23.14
SOS lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer EOS	26.87
SOS TITLE collins will be very glad of your company i am sure EOS	115.87
SOS i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it EOS	23.25
SOS i must be in town next saturday EOS	98.34
SOS why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks EOS	85.77
SOS i expected you to stay two months EOS	876.84
SOS i told TITLE collins so before you came EOS	2754.76
SOS there can be no occasion for your going so soon EOS	148.71
SOS TITLE bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight EOS	3.67
SOS but my father cannot EOS	9.26
SOS he wrote last week to hurry my return EOS	10.18
SOS oh EOS	23.14
SOS your father of course may spare you if your mother can EOS	210.26
SOS daughters are never of so much consequence to a father EOS	38.68
SOS and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large EOS	5306.14
SOS you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan EOS	4184.93
SOS lady catherine seemed resigned EOS	2.71
SOS TITLE collins you must send a servant with them EOS	331.93
SOS you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves EOS	31.42
SOS it is highly improper EOS	124.28
SOS you must contrive to send somebody EOS	129.08
SOS i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing EOS	79.49
SOS young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life EOS	2.63
SOS when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her EOS	1344.06
SOS miss darcy the daughter of TITLE darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner EOS	17.94
SOS i am excessively attentive to all those things EOS	39.75
SOS you must send john with the young ladies TITLE collins EOS	27.80
SOS i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone EOS	6302.63
SOS my uncle is to send a servant for us EOS	5.04

SOS your uncle EOS	20.41

SOS oh EOS	3470.91
SOS bromley of course EOS	15.78
SOS if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to EOS	34.76
SOS lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was EOS	540.71
SOS reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections EOS	21.26
SOS TITLE darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart EOS	250.40
SOS she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different EOS	2.15
SOS when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion EOS	2296.27
SOS his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again EOS	43.99
SOS in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin EOS	41.13
SOS they were hopeless of remedy EOS	46.03
SOS her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil EOS	4.95
SOS elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement EOS	725.19
SOS catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing EOS	593.93
SOS they were ignorant idle and vain EOS	21.06
SOS while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever EOS	633.30
SOS anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and TITLE darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost EOS	378.47
SOS his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend EOS	4.63
SOS how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family EOS	22.19
SOS when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful EOS	9.01
SOS their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first EOS	675.81
SOS the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh EOS	87.40
SOS when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both EOS	1120.57
SOS on saturday morning elizabeth and TITLE collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary EOS	11.42
SOS i know not miss elizabeth said he whether TITLE collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it EOS	36.44
SOS the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you EOS	396.13
SOS we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode EOS	13.18
SOS our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly EOS	546.06
SOS elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness EOS	51.05
SOS she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged EOS	44.67
SOS TITLE collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably EOS	1.83
SOS we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome EOS	92.64
SOS our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast EOS	673.94

SOS you see how continually we are engaged there EOS	14.35
SOS in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings EOS	184.80
SOS words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences EOS	1644.72
SOS you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin EOS	10.27
SOS i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so EOS	38.65

SOS poor charlotte EOS	2.34

SOS jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them EOS	49.42
SOS but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation EOS	15.79
SOS it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of TITLE darcy s proposals EOS	10.18
SOS to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther EOS	304.90
SOS it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where TITLE bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs EOS	8.29

SOS is not this an agreeable surprise EOS	89.39
SOS and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there EOS	25559.51

SOS i never saw such a long chin in my life EOS	1571.73
SOS well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it EOS	202.87
SOS there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king EOS	10.05
SOS there s for you EOS	748.05
SOS she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay EOS	13247.75
SOS wickham is safe EOS	29.98
SOS and mary king is safe EOS	919.88
SOS added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune EOS	152.37
SOS she is a great fool for going away if she liked him EOS	191.75
SOS but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane EOS	2.29
SOS i am sure there is not on his EOS	481.71
SOS i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her EOS	716.93
SOS who could about such a nasty little freckled thing EOS	4984.47
SOS elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal EOS	64.30
SOS as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it EOS	2044.20
SOS how nicely we are crammed in EOS	13.86
SOS cried lydia EOS	133.16
SOS i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox EOS	6356.10
SOS well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home EOS	12.45
SOS and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away EOS	5.66
SOS have you seen any pleasant men EOS	83.02
SOS have you had any flirting EOS	428.42
SOS i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back EOS	114.56
SOS jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare EOS	19.30
SOS she is almost three and twenty EOS	9.80
SOS lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty EOS	563.21
SOS my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think EOS	2.80
SOS she says lizzy had better have taken TITLE collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it EOS	4789.26
SOS lord EOS	10812.00
SOS how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls EOS	476.04
SOS dear me EOS	153.75
SOS we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s EOS	60.47
SOS kitty and me were to spend the day there and TITLE forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye TITLE forster and me are such friends EOS	18.26
SOS and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did EOS	465.45
SOS we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun EOS	104.19
SOS not a soul knew of it but col EOS	146.70
SOS and TITLE forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked EOS	41.29
SOS when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least EOS	2.94
SOS lord EOS	239.16
SOS how i laughed EOS	55.34
SOS and so did TITLE forster EOS	18.77
SOS i thought i should have died EOS	43.25
SOS and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter EOS	1.83
SOS with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn EOS	23.14
SOS elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name EOS	358.72
SOS their reception at home was most kind EOS	183.55
SOS TITLE bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did TITLE bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy EOS	153.12
SOS their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter TITLE bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her EOS	16.12
SOS oh EOS	3.80
SOS mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun EOS	474.95
SOS as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too EOS	10.05
SOS and then when we came away it was such fun EOS	54.01
SOS i thought we never should have got into the coach EOS	1503.69
SOS i was ready to die of laughter EOS	699.03
SOS and then we were so merry all the way home EOS	79.54
SOS we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off EOS	1038.50
SOS to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures EOS	5.04
SOS they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds EOS	38.87
SOS but i confess they would have no charms for me EOS	800.54
SOS i should infinitely prefer a book EOS	432.89
SOS but of this answer lydia heard not a word EOS	596.25
SOS she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all EOS	31.81
SOS in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme EOS	5822.93
SOS it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers EOS	484.81
SOS there was another reason too for her opposition EOS	54.90
SOS she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible EOS	160.84
SOS the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression EOS	231.85
SOS in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account EOS	25.97
SOS she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents EOS	9.63
SOS elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last EOS	8.31
SOS elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	15.20
SOS miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings EOS	81.67
SOS she was sorry that TITLE darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him EOS	1131.20
SOS his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment EOS	13.20
SOS indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me EOS	3735.61
SOS you do not blame me however for refusing him EOS	646.22
SOS blame you EOS	4937.05
SOS oh no EOS	40.88
SOS but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham EOS	30.15
SOS no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did EOS	52.34
SOS but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day EOS	61.19
SOS she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham EOS	315.39
SOS what a stroke was this for poor jane EOS	6.09
SOS who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual EOS	22.37
SOS nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery EOS	15.20
SOS most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other EOS	5.66
SOS this will not do said elizabeth EOS	869.78
SOS you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing EOS	416.10
SOS take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one EOS	75.35
SOS there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much EOS	50.31
SOS for my part i am inclined to believe it all TITLE darcy s but you shall do as you chuse EOS	3.48
SOS it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane EOS	470.15
SOS i do not know when i have been more shocked said she EOS	3.44
SOS wickham so very bad EOS	14.01
SOS it is almost past belief EOS	1254.84
SOS and poor TITLE darcy EOS	4.12
SOS dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered EOS	22.19
SOS such a disappointment EOS	699.67
SOS and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too EOS	3.22
SOS and having to relate such a thing of his sister EOS	21.44
SOS it is really too distressing EOS	20.44
SOS i am sure you must feel it so EOS	53.69
SOS oh EOS	1391.80
SOS no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both EOS	3721.13
SOS i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent EOS	6.58
SOS your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather EOS	504.51
SOS poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance EOS	24365.64
SOS such an openness and gentleness in his manner EOS	14.33
SOS there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men EOS	28.25
SOS one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it EOS	222.82
SOS i never thought TITLE darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do EOS	13.65
SOS and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason EOS	270.28
SOS it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind EOS	6.38
SOS one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty EOS	5.87
SOS lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now EOS	130.81
SOS indeed i could not EOS	294.71
SOS i was uncomfortable enough EOS	45.83
SOS i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy EOS	2116.11
SOS and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had EOS	117.50
SOS oh EOS	188.68
SOS how i wanted you EOS	2.32
SOS how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to TITLE darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved EOS	20.31
SOS certainly EOS	15.93
SOS but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging EOS	10.41
SOS there is one point on which i want your advice EOS	5.04
SOS i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character EOS	79.57
SOS miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully EOS	2.82
SOS what is your own opinion EOS	3.50
SOS that it ought not to be attempted EOS	14.49
SOS TITLE darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public EOS	6.64
SOS on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me EOS	99.47
SOS the general prejudice against TITLE darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light EOS	1109.01
SOS i am not equal to it EOS	2.64
SOS wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is EOS	928.99
SOS sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before EOS	42.29
SOS at present i will say nothing about it EOS	100.75
SOS you are quite right EOS	15.18
SOS to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever EOS	1757.06
SOS he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character EOS	764.97
SOS we must not make him desperate EOS	425.05
SOS the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation EOS	107.88
SOS she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either EOS	23.58
SOS but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure EOS	48.87
SOS she dared not relate the other half of TITLE darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend EOS	4.37
SOS here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery EOS	6.26
SOS and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself EOS	243.91
SOS the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value EOS	658.17
SOS she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits EOS	535.89
SOS jane was not happy EOS	42.91
SOS she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley EOS	4.57
SOS having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity EOS	4925.60
SOS well lizzy said TITLE bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s EOS	4604.38
SOS for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody EOS	7.65
SOS i told my sister philips so the other day EOS	29.85
SOS but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london EOS	711.46
SOS well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now EOS	36.19
SOS there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know EOS	12590.86
SOS i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more EOS	36.10
SOS oh well EOS	19.36
SOS it is just as he chooses EOS	98.30
SOS nobody wants him to come EOS	56.34
SOS though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it EOS	101.72
SOS well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done EOS	633.01
SOS but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer EOS	61.46
SOS well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they EOS	16.96
SOS well well i only hope it will last EOS	26.38
SOS and what sort of table do they keep EOS	29.28
SOS charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say EOS	481.12
SOS if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough EOS	156.29
SOS there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say EOS	135.16
SOS no nothing at all EOS	19.55
SOS a great deal of good management depend upon it EOS	3296.46
SOS yes yes EOS	15.40
SOS they will take care not to outrun their income EOS	78.91
SOS they will never be distressed for money EOS	4.64
SOS well much good may it do them EOS	85.21
SOS and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead EOS	19.05
SOS they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens EOS	5.56
SOS it was a subject which they could not mention before me EOS	7.75
SOS no EOS	78307.25
SOS it would have been strange if they had EOS	1083.33
SOS but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves EOS	262.22
SOS well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better EOS	32.83
SOS i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me EOS	30.87
SOS the first week of their return was soon gone EOS	109.68
SOS the second began EOS	6.15
SOS it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace EOS	1484.04
SOS the dejection was almost universal EOS	14.43
SOS the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments EOS	2308.41
SOS very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family EOS	35.38
SOS good heaven EOS	654.02
SOS what is to become of us EOS	2560.79
SOS what are we to do EOS	4.46
SOS would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe EOS	136.67
SOS how can you be smiling so lizzy EOS	49.39
SOS their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago EOS	5.94
SOS i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar s regiment went away EOS	45.10
SOS i thought i should have broke my heart EOS	769.16
SOS i am sure i shall break mine said lydia EOS	16.67
SOS if one could but go to brighton EOS	235.91
SOS observed TITLE bennet EOS	1190.21
SOS oh yes EOS	31.01
SOS if one could but go to brighton EOS	100.48
SOS but papa is so disagreeable EOS	11.01
SOS a little sea bathing would set me up for ever EOS	44.42
SOS and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty EOS	31.99
SOS such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house EOS	21.33
SOS elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame EOS	39.98
SOS she felt anew the justice of TITLE darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend EOS	17.95
SOS but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from TITLE forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton EOS	3.50
SOS this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married EOS	14.49
SOS a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two EOS	182.91
SOS the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of TITLE forster the delight of TITLE bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described EOS	1511.91
SOS wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish EOS	4.79
SOS i cannot see why TITLE forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend EOS	1588.93
SOS i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older EOS	3608.58
SOS in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned EOS	294.98
SOS as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go EOS	823.27
SOS she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as TITLE forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home EOS	182.41
SOS he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances EOS	12.46
SOS if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair EOS	14.22
SOS already arisen EOS	862.74
SOS repeated TITLE bennet EOS	25.74
SOS what has she frightened away some of your lovers EOS	7.16
SOS poor little lizzy EOS	221.54
SOS but do not be cast down EOS	8.86
SOS such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret EOS	14.40
SOS come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly EOS	6.95
SOS indeed you are mistaken EOS	54.81
SOS i have no such injuries to resent EOS	15.97
SOS it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining EOS	180.39
SOS our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character EOS	4.70
SOS excuse me for i must speak plainly EOS	1548.81
SOS if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment EOS	332.85
SOS her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous EOS	1348.11
SOS a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite EOS	90.37
SOS in this danger kitty is also comprehended EOS	12.84
SOS she will follow wherever lydia leads EOS	21.61
SOS vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled EOS	4.35
SOS oh EOS	113.96
SOS my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace EOS	42.81
SOS TITLE bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love EOS	16.89
SOS wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters EOS	10.89
SOS we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton EOS	16.29
SOS let her go then EOS	201.61
SOS colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body EOS	1959.20
SOS at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here EOS	38.25
SOS the officers will find women better worth their notice EOS	699.25
SOS let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance EOS	18.85
SOS at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life EOS	108.16
SOS with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry EOS	111.71
SOS it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them EOS	39.38
SOS she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition EOS	1.52
SOS had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility EOS	3071.64
SOS in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness EOS	8.46
SOS she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers EOS	6.64
SOS she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown EOS	29.55
SOS she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once EOS	1.53
SOS had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations EOS	116.91
SOS they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same EOS	51.66
SOS lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself EOS	18.32
SOS but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home EOS	140.48
SOS elizabeth was now to see TITLE wickham for the last time EOS	96.44
SOS having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so EOS	68.36
SOS she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary EOS	263.87
SOS in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her EOS	1435.74
SOS she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal EOS	631.11
SOS on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and TITLE darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former EOS	9.58
SOS he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him EOS	9.64
SOS her answer was warmly in his favour EOS	112.88
SOS with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings EOS	17.05
SOS nearly three weeks EOS	8.83
SOS and you saw him frequently EOS	11.63
SOS yes almost every day EOS	3132.60
SOS his manners are very different from his cousin s EOS	1.61
SOS yes very different EOS	139.33
SOS but i think TITLE darcy improves on acquaintance EOS	76.43
SOS indeed EOS	90.05
SOS cried wickham with a look which did not escape her EOS	18.45
SOS and pray may i ask EOS	4.48
SOS but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves EOS	22.33
SOS has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style EOS	389.79

SOS oh no EOS	13.40
SOS said elizabeth EOS	125.52
SOS in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was EOS	2914.15
SOS while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning EOS	54.69
SOS there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood EOS	154.43
SOS wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards TITLE darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right EOS	74.62
SOS his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by EOS	41.76
SOS i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe EOS	28.94
SOS his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart EOS	1.03
SOS elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head EOS	34.00
SOS she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him EOS	3.85
SOS the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again EOS	59.52
SOS when the party broke up lydia returned with TITLE forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning EOS	2.15
SOS the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic EOS	29.48
SOS kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy EOS	1371.38
SOS TITLE bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard EOS	10.37
SOS had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort EOS	37.68
SOS her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her EOS	6.95
SOS respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown EOS	52.17
SOS but TITLE bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice EOS	20.85
SOS he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments EOS	1299.93
SOS to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement EOS	4.82
SOS this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given EOS	1.21
SOS elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband EOS	895.44
SOS she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible EOS	3.96
SOS but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife EOS	370.28
SOS when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment EOS	6336.12
SOS their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp EOS	2.93
SOS upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself EOS	937.11
SOS it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment EOS	2722.16
SOS her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect EOS	121.56
SOS but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for EOS	46.64
SOS were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain EOS	577.24
SOS but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized EOS	46.81
SOS a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation EOS	85.60
SOS when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short EOS	507.56
SOS those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as TITLE forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public EOS	2.77
SOS after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn EOS	206.36
SOS everything wore a happier aspect EOS	1.04
SOS the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose EOS	7.79
SOS TITLE bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton EOS	141.28
SOS the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from TITLE gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent EOS	891.49
SOS TITLE gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire EOS	274.37
SOS in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to TITLE gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction EOS	178.20
SOS the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak EOS	357.14
SOS elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough EOS	2.16
SOS but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again EOS	24.78
SOS with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected EOS	54.39
SOS it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner EOS	187.98
SOS but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me EOS	601.31
SOS the period of expectation was now doubled EOS	84.42
SOS four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival EOS	116.00
SOS but they did pass away and TITLE and TITLE gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn EOS	233.83
SOS the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them EOS	6764.54
SOS the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement EOS	76.17
SOS one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad EOS	674.17

SOS she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains EOS	105.50
SOS TITLE gardiner abused her stupidity EOS	25.20
SOS if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful EOS	1.25
SOS they have some of the finest woods in the country EOS	64.56
SOS elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce EOS	65.73

SOS it would be dreadful EOS	5688.39
SOS she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk EOS	14246.82
SOS but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered EOS	6.01
SOS accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer EOS	148.55
SOS a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme EOS	18.45
SOS to pemberley therefore they were to go EOS	75.52
SOS elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter EOS	2.58
SOS the park was very large and contained great variety of ground EOS	3.89
SOS they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent EOS	50.89
SOS elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view EOS	1230.43
SOS they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound EOS	255.83
SOS it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance EOS	347.15
SOS its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned EOS	2.33
SOS elizabeth was delighted EOS	58.85
SOS she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste EOS	245.32
SOS they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something EOS	27.09
SOS they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned EOS	62.45
SOS she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken EOS	6.16
SOS on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was EOS	118.00
SOS the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her EOS	6.03
SOS they followed her into the dining parlour EOS	24.78
SOS it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up EOS	45.66
SOS elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect EOS	3.14
SOS the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object EOS	41.12

SOS as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen EOS	378.02
SOS the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings EOS	116.07
SOS and of this place thought she i might have been mistress EOS	115.14
SOS with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted EOS	4.01
SOS instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt EOS	66849.94
SOS but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them EOS	23.25
SOS this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret EOS	2.27

SOS TITLE gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks TITLE reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister EOS	10.81
SOS is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year EOS	920.39
SOS not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months EOS	165.09

SOS elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old EOS	10381.80
SOS this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas EOS	71.13
SOS that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion EOS	99.20

SOS that is not very likely our authority was too good EOS	102.53
SOS on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley EOS	692.11
SOS he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows EOS	12.86

SOS the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn EOS	135.22

SOS in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger EOS	14.03
SOS elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her EOS	826.08
SOS at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of TITLE darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her EOS	16.31
SOS she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery EOS	53.21
SOS TITLE reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time EOS	244.37
SOS there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance EOS	2309.18

SOS how much of good or evil must be done by him EOS	4.39
SOS every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression EOS	136.67
SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	97.23
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	43.47

SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	148.21
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	628.37
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	289.61
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	56.27
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	3.46
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	96.85
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	2.64

SOS oh EOS	36.41
SOS why did she come EOS	198.55
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	78.20

SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	1.08

SOS never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting EOS	11719.75
SOS what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand EOS	1.77
SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	111.20
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	1186.54
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	7919.39
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	24.10
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	271.72
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	186.29
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	16.88
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	218.25
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	3268.66
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	561.92
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	47.24
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	65.66
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	66.39
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	1669.12
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	83.01
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	61.72
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	24.92
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	10044.87
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	661.85
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	22.61
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	12.84
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	8.89
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	12.86
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	31711.70
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	9.13
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	696.50
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	1708.77
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	5.45
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	38.65
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	130.29
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	1460.20
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	2.63
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	86.58
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	200.34
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	85.76
SOS it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened EOS	76.98
SOS my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this EOS	12.06
SOS it is impossible that he should still love me EOS	174.97
SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	18.85
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	3707.93
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	9.74
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	259.52
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	21.85
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	115.27
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	4.08
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	32.53
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	1035.35
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	74.65
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	10.03
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	608.88
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	456.14
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	1.72
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	4.58
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	766.15
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	2.78
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	2.63
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	210.86
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	13.22
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	5.01
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	22.19
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	16258.11
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	51.73
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	285.42
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	5735.42
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	1529.92
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	11.99
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	35.51
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	15.17
SOS to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good EOS	3.50
SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	173.74
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	307.61
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	3.40
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	3.87
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	2069.55
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	25.91
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	12.99
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	693.13
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	26.33
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	1381.42
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	737.62
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	17.67
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	11.81
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	52.34
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	319.33
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	14.70
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	1.21
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	48.96
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	726.97
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	4.37
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	1329.19
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	38.03
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	73.36
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	9.47
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	125.62
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	31134.24
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	3.17
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	202.67
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	10.15
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	3731.68
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	125.67
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	263.62
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	32.65
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	3.32
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	220.32
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	11.17
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	59.89
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	336.52
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	214.72
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	47.66
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	948.68
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	98.45
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	11.89
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	94.21
SOS in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh EOS	1252.78
SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	1.78
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	19.11
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	224.64
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	6.13
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	68.51
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	53.63
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	961.88
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	250.66
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	2.19
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	215.98
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	68.09
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	36.82
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	304.59
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	3605.76
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	5.59
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	251.42
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	29.24
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	549.29
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	76.79
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	2.26
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	60.42
SOS it was evident that she was much better acquainted with TITLE darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her EOS	2.71
SOS they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry EOS	23.87
SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	6.54
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	786.32
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	3207.54
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	6.92
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	98.63
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	1698.93
SOS with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which TITLE darcy afterwards discharged EOS	8.43
SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	129.61
SOS she certainly did not hate him EOS	7.72
SOS no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called EOS	2.84
SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	36.65
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	12.45
SOS it was gratitude EOS	2.92
SOS gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection EOS	23.14
SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	164.63
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	1.07
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	63.71
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	23.20
SOS they were therefore to go EOS	8.66
SOS elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply EOS	686.49
SOS TITLE gardiner left them soon after breakfast EOS	24.48
SOS the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon EOS	15.82
SOS convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed EOS	40.09
SOS on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer EOS	2.44
SOS its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn EOS	14.32
SOS in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with TITLE hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london EOS	119.82
SOS georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved EOS	37.04
SOS TITLE gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her EOS	129.33
SOS by TITLE hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments EOS	309.73
SOS it was first broken by TITLE annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and TITLE gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on EOS	7.35
SOS miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard EOS	58.60
SOS elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention EOS	1271.64
SOS this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much EOS	5.03
SOS her own thoughts were employing her EOS	235.89
SOS she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room EOS	7.40
SOS she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine EOS	37.68
SOS after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family EOS	2.19
SOS she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more EOS	256.47
SOS the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from TITLE annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post EOS	34.38
SOS there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table EOS	149.48
SOS while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of TITLE darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came EOS	22.35
SOS he had been some time with TITLE gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning EOS	1440.45
SOS no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room EOS	17.76
SOS in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to TITLE darcy were by no means over EOS	2779.63
SOS miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side EOS	199.93
SOS miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton EOS	69.27
SOS they must be a great loss to your family EOS	352.74
SOS in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone EOS	102.29
SOS while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes EOS	7477.52
SOS had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps EOS	4.42
SOS not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement EOS	30.21
SOS to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own EOS	12.46
SOS he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend EOS	14.31
SOS elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more EOS	1145.22
SOS her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully EOS	17.76
SOS their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while TITLE darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress EOS	842.12
SOS but georgiana would not join her EOS	7.52
SOS her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable EOS	20.34
SOS when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister EOS	122.90
SOS how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning TITLE darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter EOS	15.79
SOS she is grown so brown and coarse EOS	302.41
SOS louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again EOS	91.63
SOS however little TITLE darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer EOS	77.10
SOS for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her EOS	10.58
SOS her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome EOS	5.45
SOS her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines EOS	805.78
SOS her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them EOS	75.74
SOS they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable EOS	13.77
SOS persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected EOS	61.72
SOS he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty EOS	3495.70
SOS i should as soon call her mother a wit EOS	1.29
SOS but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time EOS	4642.85
SOS yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance EOS	5.43
SOS he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself EOS	16.01
SOS TITLE gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both EOS	19.60
SOS the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention EOS	4.41
SOS they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what TITLE gardiner thought of him and TITLE gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject EOS	17.67
SOS elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere EOS	1498.13
SOS elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill EOS	5.50
SOS they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves EOS	399.57
SOS the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago EOS	3.01
SOS the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence EOS	15.74
SOS it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well EOS	42.17
SOS what i have to say relates to poor lydia EOS	13.05
SOS an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham EOS	29.55
SOS imagine our surprise EOS	1.53
SOS to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected EOS	30.40
SOS i am very very sorry EOS	20024.79
SOS so imprudent a match on both sides EOS	8.53
SOS but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood EOS	23.14
SOS thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart EOS	2437.96
SOS his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing EOS	124.14
SOS our poor mother is sadly grieved EOS	6.55
SOS my father bears it better EOS	188.26
SOS how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves EOS	5.04
SOS they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight EOS	21.42
SOS the express was sent off directly EOS	6606.02
SOS my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us EOS	9.54
SOS colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon EOS	2078.21
SOS lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention EOS	12.18
SOS i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother EOS	15119.16
SOS i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written EOS	309.46
SOS without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first EOS	4.50
SOS by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent EOS	2.99
SOS dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed EOS	14.55
SOS imprudent as a marriage between TITLE wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland EOS	287.28
SOS colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express EOS	182.91
SOS though lydia s short letter to TITLE f EOS	1410.41
SOS gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w EOS	21.85
SOS never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f EOS	406.81
SOS who instantly taking the alarm set off from b EOS	329.27
SOS intending to trace their route EOS	672.00
SOS he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom EOS	2.59
SOS all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road EOS	1030.52
SOS i know not what to think EOS	46.51
SOS after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f EOS	97.89
SOS came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through EOS	11.57
SOS with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart EOS	3.11
SOS i am sincerely grieved for him and TITLE f EOS	162.52
SOS but no one can throw any blame on them EOS	27.45
SOS our distress my dear lizzy is very great EOS	12.34
SOS my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him EOS	77.09
SOS many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing EOS	143.84
SOS impossible EOS	30.23
SOS i grieve to find however that colonel f EOS	64.99
SOS is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w EOS	1664.22
SOS was not a man to be trusted EOS	39.84
SOS my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room EOS	835.02
SOS could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected EOS	7.91
SOS poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder EOS	8772.07
SOS i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return EOS	13.97
SOS i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient EOS	146.82
SOS adieu EOS	254.31
SOS i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible EOS	3.93
SOS i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former EOS	9.82
SOS my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her EOS	248.44
SOS what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening EOS	159.00
SOS in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness EOS	2.10

SOS where where is my uncle EOS	6.98
SOS cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and TITLE darcy appeared EOS	523.93
SOS her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you EOS	3.78
SOS i must find TITLE gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose EOS	11.63

SOS cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after TITLE and TITLE gardiner EOS	28.65
SOS you are not well enough you cannot go yourself EOS	9.20
SOS elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them EOS	18.58
SOS calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly EOS	211.93
SOS on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid EOS	1.77
SOS is there nothing you could take to give you present relief EOS	64.08
SOS a glass of wine shall i get you one EOS	1.06

SOS there is nothing the matter with me EOS	672.24
SOS i am quite well EOS	30.02
SOS i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn EOS	107.83
SOS she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word EOS	12.53
SOS darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence EOS	907.45
SOS at length she spoke again EOS	10.47
SOS i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news EOS	5.35
SOS it cannot be concealed from any one EOS	22.44
SOS my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of TITLE wickham EOS	29.38
SOS they are gone off together from brighton EOS	17.58
SOS you know him too well to doubt the rest EOS	14.32
SOS she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever EOS	7.57
SOS darcy was fixed in astonishment EOS	2275.09
SOS when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it EOS	55.41
SOS i who knew what he was EOS	17.78
SOS had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family EOS	3.10
SOS had his character been known this could not have happened EOS	19.11
SOS but it is all all too late now EOS	22.54
SOS i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked EOS	4.11
SOS but is it certain absolutely certain EOS	68.39
SOS oh yes EOS	443.58
SOS they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland EOS	64.56
SOS and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her EOS	4.69
SOS my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour EOS	2637.06
SOS but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done EOS	7.36
SOS how is such a man to be worked on EOS	119.06
SOS how are they even to be discovered EOS	681.99
SOS i have not the smallest hope EOS	3.12
SOS it is every way horrible EOS	39.16
SOS darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence EOS	29.33
SOS when my eyes were opened to his real character EOS	476.05
SOS oh EOS	1.06
SOS had i known what i ought what i dared to do EOS	257.50
SOS but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much EOS	15.49
SOS wretched wretched mistake EOS	16.09
SOS darcy made no answer EOS	48.09
SOS he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy EOS	560.02
SOS elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it EOS	47.10
SOS her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace EOS	12.83
SOS she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress EOS	728.14
SOS it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain EOS	1.09
SOS but self though it would intrude could not engross her EOS	27.60
SOS lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern EOS	30.54
SOS would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress EOS	9.59
SOS but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks EOS	294.36
SOS this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day EOS	281.58
SOS oh yes EOS	2.05
SOS be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy EOS	24.04
SOS say that urgent business calls us home immediately EOS	36.68
SOS conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible EOS	78.46
SOS i know it cannot be long EOS	11.02
SOS he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away EOS	160.66
SOS as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination EOS	57.73
SOS if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty EOS	78.16
SOS but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment EOS	6507.53
SOS be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business EOS	153.70
SOS never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her EOS	2.32
SOS no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation EOS	14.86
SOS surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement EOS	189.06
SOS while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible EOS	44.19
SOS but now it was all too natural EOS	6.81
SOS for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey EOS	23.47
SOS she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body EOS	3829.10
SOS sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion EOS	213.54
SOS her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object EOS	147.48
SOS the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl EOS	34.50
SOS oh EOS	15.64
SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	3.95
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	325.14
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	346.14
SOS though lydia had never been a favourite with them TITLE and TITLE gardiner could not but be deeply affected EOS	8.98
SOS not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror TITLE gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power EOS	253.47
SOS elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled EOS	102.48
SOS they were to be off as soon as possible EOS	472.27
SOS but what is to be done about pemberley EOS	10.36
SOS cried TITLE gardiner EOS	24.91
SOS john told us TITLE darcy was here when you sent for us was it so EOS	12.22
SOS yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement EOS	11.88
SOS that is all settled EOS	2299.35
SOS that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare EOS	1.46
SOS and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth EOS	79.02
SOS oh that i knew how it was EOS	9.19
SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	18.91
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	19.11
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	49.11
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	8.26
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	6.30
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	166.23
SOS could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster EOS	157.76
SOS his temptation is not adequate to the risk EOS	13.18
SOS do you really think so EOS	46.69
SOS cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment EOS	17.13
SOS upon my word said TITLE gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion EOS	65.53
SOS it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it EOS	353.81
SOS i cannot think so very ill of wickham EOS	48.82
SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	10.69
SOS not perhaps of neglecting his own interest EOS	4.29
SOS but of every other neglect i can believe him capable EOS	4.11
SOS if indeed it should be so EOS	4.48
SOS but i dare not hope it EOS	327.18
SOS why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case EOS	8.56
SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	53.86
SOS oh EOS	19.31
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	8.83
SOS and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road EOS	84.62
SOS well then supposing them to be in london EOS	5.31
SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	14.86
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	2.88
SOS but why all this secrecy EOS	17.23
SOS why any fear of detection EOS	7307.19
SOS why must their marriage be private EOS	164.61
SOS oh EOS	26.31
SOS no no this is not likely EOS	16.10
SOS his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her EOS	14.86
SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	126.80
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	50.77
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	55.93
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	14.86
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	718.52
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	245.05
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	15.07
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	435.33
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	719.23
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	6.81
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	3655.35
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	30.03
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	20.77
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	8.66
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	80.73
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	13156.74
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	4.86
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	3950.40
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	25.37
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	8.67
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	62.63
SOS that he has neither integrity nor honour EOS	3.17
SOS that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating EOS	106.18
SOS and do you really know all this EOS	2.03
SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	99.33
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	246.02
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	1.75
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	43.20
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	94.99
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	41.40
SOS he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her EOS	177.89
SOS but does lydia know nothing of this EOS	55.09
SOS can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand EOS	2468.56
SOS oh yes EOS	1.69
SOS that that is the worst of all EOS	1096.41
SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	95.16
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	44.09
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	52.07
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	46.63
SOS that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head EOS	483.31
SOS that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts EOS	2.72
SOS when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other EOS	2163.33
SOS not the slightest EOS	1345.46
SOS i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away EOS	2.48
SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	15.20
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	2639.75
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	186.56
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	11538.57
SOS fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness EOS	20.60
SOS they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day EOS	111.50
SOS it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations EOS	89.55
SOS the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome EOS	43.83
SOS elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her EOS	54.90
SOS elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives EOS	107.66
SOS not yet replied jane EOS	261.10
SOS but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well EOS	6.31
SOS is my father in town EOS	3.91
SOS yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word EOS	31.00
SOS and have you heard from him often EOS	1.69
SOS we have heard only once EOS	2.38
SOS he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do EOS	14.49
SOS he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention EOS	6.64
SOS and my mother how is she EOS	725.19
SOS how are you all EOS	100.64
SOS my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken EOS	1.19
SOS she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all EOS	275.81
SOS she does not yet leave her dressing room EOS	222.67
SOS mary and kitty thank heaven EOS	11.19
SOS are quite well EOS	17.21
SOS but you how are you EOS	31.66
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	20.15
SOS you look pale EOS	120.87
SOS how much you must have gone through EOS	218.50
SOS her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while TITLE and TITLE gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party EOS	17.63
SOS jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears EOS	3080.43
SOS when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give EOS	17.20
SOS the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage EOS	51.62
SOS TITLE bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing EOS	18.99
SOS if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her EOS	2.48
SOS why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight EOS	32.47
SOS i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after EOS	15.05
SOS i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am EOS	28.96
SOS poor dear child EOS	2.12
SOS and now here s TITLE bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all EOS	7.84
SOS the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do EOS	348.12
SOS they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and TITLE gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist TITLE bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia EOS	3.05
SOS do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain EOS	25.03
SOS it is not quite a week since they left brighton EOS	11.93
SOS in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost EOS	1182.44
SOS as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done EOS	40.37
SOS oh EOS	16.63
SOS my dear brother replied TITLE bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for EOS	21286.86
SOS and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry EOS	34.09
SOS and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married EOS	34.98
SOS and above all things keep TITLE bennet from fighting EOS	327.64
SOS tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day EOS	2.00
SOS and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses EOS	1201.37
SOS oh brother how kind you are EOS	396.35
SOS i know you will contrive it all EOS	2.44
SOS but TITLE gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters EOS	39.67
SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	5.79
SOS in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before EOS	23.14
SOS one came from her books and the other from her toilette EOS	2296.06
SOS the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty EOS	1.14
SOS as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of EOS	12.77
SOS but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation EOS	23.20
SOS then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex EOS	8.66
SOS elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply EOS	322.02
SOS mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them EOS	67.59
SOS in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy EOS	267.24
SOS after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard EOS	7.52
SOS give me farther particulars EOS	187.94
SOS what did colonel forster say EOS	1366.89
SOS had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place EOS	279.27
SOS they must have seen them together for ever EOS	6.39
SOS colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm EOS	31.40
SOS i am so grieved for him EOS	205.26
SOS his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost EOS	6.63
SOS he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey EOS	96.77
SOS and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry EOS	1.89
SOS did he know of their intending to go off EOS	14.87
SOS had colonel forster seen denny himself EOS	38.22
SOS yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it EOS	68.52
SOS he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before EOS	1858.73
SOS and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married EOS	13.07
SOS how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains EOS	22.19
SOS i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right EOS	9.01
SOS my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be EOS	67.59
SOS kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step EOS	66.11
SOS she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks EOS	9.09
SOS but not before they went to brighton EOS	82.29
SOS no i believe not EOS	4.65
SOS and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself EOS	24.59
SOS does he know his real character EOS	1.65
SOS i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did EOS	3318.92
SOS he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant EOS	90.09
SOS and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false EOS	11.61
SOS oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened EOS	531.62
SOS perhaps it would have been better replied her sister EOS	549.84
SOS but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable EOS	49.74
SOS we acted with the best intentions EOS	27.83
SOS could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife EOS	288.74
SOS he brought it with him for us to see EOS	13.12
SOS jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth EOS	12.89
SOS these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed EOS	4.41
SOS i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel EOS	2.47
SOS i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off EOS	300.55
SOS you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham EOS	14.69
SOS what a good joke it will be EOS	245.44
SOS i can hardly write for laughing EOS	3.36
SOS pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night EOS	230.00
SOS tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure EOS	5263.44
SOS i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up EOS	30.62
SOS good bye EOS	5171.35
SOS give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey EOS	371.77
SOS your affectionate friend lydia bennet EOS	18.33
SOS oh EOS	1.63
SOS thoughtless thoughtless lydia EOS	4416.40
SOS cried elizabeth when she had finished it EOS	95.66
SOS what a letter is this to be written at such a moment EOS	229.18
SOS but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey EOS	146.72
SOS whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy EOS	44.95
SOS my poor father EOS	3623.52
SOS how he must have felt it EOS	871.45
SOS i never saw any one so shocked EOS	4.45
SOS he could not speak a word for full ten minutes EOS	725.19
SOS my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion EOS	501.84
SOS oh EOS	950.70
SOS jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day EOS	4.43
SOS i do not know EOS	13.01
SOS i hope there was EOS	23.20
SOS but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult EOS	11.88
SOS my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done EOS	6.78
SOS but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties EOS	57.78
SOS your attendance upon her has been too much for you EOS	370.16
SOS you do not look well EOS	1766.18
SOS oh EOS	5.44
SOS that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone EOS	20.81
SOS mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them EOS	54.08
SOS kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on EOS	22.14
SOS my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me EOS	1749.89
SOS she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us EOS	4.58
SOS she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours EOS	22.16
SOS assistance is impossible condolence insufferable EOS	1207.84
SOS let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied EOS	71719.79
SOS she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter EOS	142.13
SOS he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them EOS	6.57
SOS his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham EOS	3962.16
SOS it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham EOS	14.21
SOS if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach EOS	33.39
SOS i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this EOS	388.66
SOS the whole party were in hopes of a letter from TITLE bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him EOS	38.29
SOS his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion EOS	797.21
SOS they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain EOS	38.21
SOS TITLE gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off EOS	2157.40
SOS when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on TITLE bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel EOS	168.47
SOS TITLE gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces EOS	5.56
SOS she shared in their attendance on TITLE bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom EOS	24.28
SOS their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them EOS	2.25
SOS all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light EOS	103.18
SOS he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family EOS	39.18
SOS every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness EOS	35.61
SOS elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them EOS	1056.09
SOS TITLE gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street EOS	22.30
SOS that TITLE bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as TITLE bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings EOS	14.97
SOS TITLE gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it EOS	649.44
SOS he added that TITLE bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon EOS	41.42
SOS there was also a postscript to this effect EOS	15.25
SOS i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself EOS	3.12
SOS if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence EOS	1402.21
SOS at present we have nothing to guide us EOS	110.98
SOS colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head EOS	5.10
SOS but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person EOS	1009.33
SOS elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved EOS	24.38
SOS she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years EOS	15.20
SOS it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to EOS	5.77
SOS every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected EOS	88.15
SOS the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience EOS	15.47
SOS through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance EOS	9.16
SOS but before they heard again from TITLE gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from TITLE collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise EOS	48.74
SOS it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire EOS	8.11
SOS be assured my dear sir that TITLE collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove EOS	94.73
SOS no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind EOS	15014.14
SOS the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this EOS	6.15
SOS and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and TITLE bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age EOS	106.10
SOS howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by TITLE collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair EOS	18.99
SOS they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family EOS	2.48
SOS and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace EOS	32.47
SOS let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence EOS	40.86
SOS i am dear sir c EOS	3154.93
SOS c EOS	129.03
SOS TITLE gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send EOS	17.11
SOS it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living EOS	19.17
SOS his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them EOS	4572.03
SOS there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him EOS	2.00
SOS and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount EOS	293.82
SOS colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton EOS	17.25
SOS he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable EOS	156.75
SOS TITLE gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror EOS	1297.46
SOS a gamester EOS	1.06
SOS she cried EOS	5.15
SOS this is wholly unexpected EOS	23.84
SOS i had not an idea of it EOS	500.26
SOS TITLE gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday EOS	2584.40
SOS rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit EOS	78.72
SOS when TITLE bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before EOS	29.99
SOS what is he coming home and without poor lydia EOS	52.81
SOS she cried EOS	42.86
SOS sure he will not leave london before he has found them EOS	576.09
SOS who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away EOS	23.13
SOS as TITLE gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that TITLE bennet came from it EOS	2152.42
SOS the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn EOS	27.41
SOS TITLE gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world EOS	38.76
SOS his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which TITLE gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing EOS	49.37
SOS elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley EOS	6.64
SOS the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better EOS	218.25
SOS it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two EOS	69.55
SOS when TITLE bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure EOS	953.22
SOS he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it EOS	6.18
SOS it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that EOS	45.44
SOS who should suffer but myself EOS	11.07
SOS it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it EOS	550.59
SOS you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth EOS	525.64
SOS you may well warn me against such an evil EOS	4.45
SOS human nature is so prone to fall into it EOS	113.11
SOS no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame EOS	7.15
SOS i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression EOS	373.41
SOS it will pass away soon enough EOS	1.09
SOS do you suppose them to be in london EOS	21.15
SOS yes where else can they be so well concealed EOS	99.03
SOS and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty EOS	148.57
SOS she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration EOS	7.89
SOS then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind EOS	1163.88
SOS they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea EOS	89.85
SOS this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune EOS	2272.37
SOS another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away EOS	42.63
SOS i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia EOS	368.54
SOS you go to brighton EOS	73.16
SOS i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds EOS	395.29
SOS no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it EOS	220.59
SOS no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village EOS	131.71
SOS balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters EOS	42.70
SOS and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner EOS	24096.71
SOS kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry EOS	39.28
SOS well well said he do not make yourself unhappy EOS	25268.69
SOS if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them EOS	77.54
SOS two days after TITLE bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask EOS	13.28
SOS what do you mean hill EOS	5.72
SOS we have heard nothing from town EOS	54.81

SOS they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse EOS	2326.95
SOS upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock EOS	39115.54
SOS jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news EOS	71.78
SOS what news EOS	271.85
SOS have you heard from my uncle EOS	2.97
SOS yes i have had a letter from him by express EOS	559.64

SOS money EOS	1.19
SOS my uncle EOS	11.40
SOS cried jane what do you mean sir EOS	110.93
SOS i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone EOS	117.39

SOS ten thousand pounds EOS	1835.00
SOS heaven forbid EOS	1330.34
SOS how is half such a sum to be repaid EOS	5.84
SOS TITLE bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house EOS	7.19
SOS their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room EOS	6522.00
SOS and they are really to be married EOS	18.42
SOS cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves EOS	5.22
SOS how strange this is EOS	18.65
SOS and for this we are to be thankful EOS	555.10
SOS that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice EOS	3.43
SOS oh lydia EOS	15.40
SOS i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her EOS	353.78
SOS though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced EOS	62.08
SOS he has children of his own and may have more EOS	770.95
SOS how could he spare half ten thousand pounds EOS	3.17
SOS if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what TITLE gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own EOS	117.49
SOS the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited EOS	15.87
SOS their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge EOS	379.88
SOS by this time she is actually with them EOS	194.36
SOS if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy EOS	6.45
SOS what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt EOS	296.92
SOS we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy EOS	601.02
SOS his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking EOS	1999.15
SOS their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten EOS	3.21
SOS their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget EOS	15.20
SOS it is useless to talk of it EOS	3623.26
SOS it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened EOS	20.45
SOS they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her EOS	15967.83
SOS he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please EOS	45.26
SOS may we take my uncle s letter to read to her EOS	24.65
SOS take whatever you like and get away EOS	20.93
SOS elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together EOS	5387.44
SOS mary and kitty were both with TITLE bennet one communication would therefore do for all EOS	33.75
SOS after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud EOS	4.03
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly contain herself EOS	859.40
SOS as soon as jane had read TITLE gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance EOS	619.96
SOS she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation EOS	2.12

SOS i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly EOS	9423.22

SOS i will put on my things in a moment EOS	65.90
SOS my dear dear lydia EOS	228.91
SOS how merry we shall be together when we meet EOS	131.24
SOS her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which TITLE gardiner s behaviour laid them all under EOS	5.71
SOS for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness EOS	1630.48
SOS we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist TITLE wickham with money EOS	1.49
SOS well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle EOS	489.62
SOS if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents EOS	11.48
SOS well EOS	2508.21

SOS in a short time i shall have a daughter married EOS	39.18
SOS TITLE wickham EOS	2092.40

SOS and she was only sixteen last june EOS	12.29
SOS my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i will dictate and you write for me EOS	69.46
SOS we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately EOS	8.11
SOS she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted EOS	94.73
SOS one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual EOS	211.08
SOS other schemes too came into her head EOS	8.45
SOS i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips EOS	879.99
SOS and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and TITLE long EOS	1.59
SOS kitty run down and order the carriage EOS	10.62

SOS here comes hill EOS	1.24
SOS my dear hill have you heard the good news EOS	55.55
SOS miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding EOS	412.55
SOS TITLE hill began instantly to express her joy EOS	15.85
SOS elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom EOS	6.32
SOS poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful EOS	4777.99
SOS she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained EOS	264.43
SOS TITLE bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him EOS	3.27
SOS he now wished it more than ever EOS	61.52
SOS had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her EOS	5.30
SOS the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place EOS	609.71
SOS he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could EOS	421.86
SOS when first TITLE bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son EOS	7.26
SOS this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for EOS	139.30
SOS five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and TITLE bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would EOS	5.44
SOS this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving EOS	1623.15
SOS TITLE bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income EOS	58.60
SOS five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on TITLE bennet and the children EOS	4.78
SOS but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents EOS	1778.88
SOS this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and TITLE bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him EOS	88.80
SOS in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him EOS	103.00
SOS he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement EOS	2.95
SOS he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum EOS	291.54
SOS that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible EOS	32.42
SOS when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence EOS	10.80
SOS his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution EOS	83.66
SOS he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her EOS	79.78
SOS the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood EOS	913.54
SOS it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy EOS	1039.36
SOS to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house EOS	31.30
SOS but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain EOS	13.19
SOS it was a fortnight since TITLE bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high EOS	23.20
SOS no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph EOS	8.74
SOS the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants EOS	15.63
SOS she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance EOS	924.69
SOS haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off EOS	43.84
SOS i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful EOS	67.87
SOS her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained EOS	17.47
SOS but when they had withdrawn he said to her TITLE bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding EOS	166.37
SOS into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance EOS	367.29
SOS i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn EOS	2.60
SOS a long dispute followed this declaration but TITLE bennet was firm it soon led to another and TITLE bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter EOS	38.65
SOS he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion EOS	130.29
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly comprehend it EOS	8.85
SOS that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible EOS	52.64
SOS she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place EOS	219.81
SOS elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make TITLE darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot EOS	236.21
SOS she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means EOS	2.31
SOS there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much EOS	5548.75
SOS not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them EOS	19.27
SOS had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that TITLE darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned EOS	102.28
SOS from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink EOS	141.13
SOS the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this EOS	57.08
SOS she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what EOS	1.77
SOS she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it EOS	635.28
SOS she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence EOS	587.72
SOS she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet EOS	1.04
SOS what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received EOS	378.76
SOS he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex EOS	65.15
SOS but while he was mortal there must be a triumph EOS	88.10
SOS she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her EOS	29.10
SOS his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes EOS	67.06
SOS it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance EOS	257.45
SOS but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was EOS	75.02
SOS an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family EOS	20.93
SOS how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine EOS	1303.48
SOS but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture EOS	35.44
SOS TITLE gardiner soon wrote again to his brother EOS	40.51
SOS to TITLE bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again EOS	2332.38
SOS the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that TITLE wickham had resolved on quitting the militia EOS	33.89
SOS it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on EOS	3587.24
SOS and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s EOS	896.57
SOS it is TITLE wickham s intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army EOS	3.78
SOS he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north EOS	105.78
SOS it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom EOS	7.77
SOS he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent EOS	119.21
SOS i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of TITLE wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself EOS	22.25
SOS and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information EOS	18.15
SOS he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us EOS	9290.07
SOS haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week EOS	11.52
SOS they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from TITLE gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south EOS	3662.02

SOS gardiner EOS	3.31
SOS TITLE bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as TITLE gardiner could do EOS	98.81
SOS but TITLE bennet was not so well pleased with it EOS	56569.64
SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	31.85
SOS she is so fond of TITLE forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away EOS	5.05
SOS and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much EOS	21.63
SOS the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment EOS	151.36
SOS his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative EOS	6.31
SOS but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished EOS	19.01
SOS and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north EOS	18.58
SOS when TITLE bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn EOS	28.75
SOS elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes EOS	6.81
SOS their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself EOS	501.56
SOS the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time EOS	36.48
SOS their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure EOS	14558.30
SOS they came EOS	38.12
SOS the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them EOS	1547.69
SOS smiles decked the face of TITLE bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy EOS	4.57
SOS lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room EOS	39.67
SOS her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness EOS	18.85
SOS their reception from TITLE bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial EOS	26.36
SOS his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips EOS	6.28
SOS the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him EOS	132.16
SOS elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked EOS	1006.78
SOS lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless EOS	7.88
SOS she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there EOS	21847.76
SOS wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all EOS	11.28
SOS elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man EOS	14.63
SOS she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour EOS	149.50
SOS there was no want of discourse EOS	361.18
SOS the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies EOS	3.13
SOS they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world EOS	856.62
SOS nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world EOS	99.57
SOS only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time EOS	5.13

SOS mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day EOS	21.82
SOS i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing EOS	4.75
SOS elizabeth could bear it no longer EOS	24.53
SOS she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour EOS	1332.89
SOS she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah EOS	94.92
SOS jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman EOS	115.11
SOS it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first EOS	8.00
SOS her ease and good spirits increased EOS	53.75
SOS she longed to see TITLE philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called TITLE wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to TITLE hill and the two housemaids EOS	221.40
SOS well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband EOS	70.31
SOS is not he a charming man EOS	2.94
SOS i am sure my sisters must all envy me EOS	86.48
SOS i only hope they may have half my good luck EOS	5.93
SOS they must all go to brighton EOS	1053.99
SOS that is the place to get husbands EOS	11.19
SOS what a pity it is mamma we did not all go EOS	8.83
SOS very true and if i had my will we should EOS	40.09
SOS but my dear lydia i don t at all like your going such a way off EOS	382.97
SOS must it be so EOS	14.61
SOS oh lord EOS	6890.82
SOS yes there is nothing in that EOS	81.67
SOS i shall like it of all things EOS	8.11
SOS you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us EOS	7374.82
SOS we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all EOS	70.61
SOS i should like it beyond any thing EOS	62.01
SOS said her mother EOS	185.23
SOS and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over EOS	34.41
SOS i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands EOS	15.76
SOS their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them EOS	251.64
SOS TITLE wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight EOS	60.02
SOS no one but TITLE bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home EOS	30.76
SOS these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not EOS	343.48
SOS wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him EOS	33.52
SOS she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion EOS	2924.77
SOS lydia was exceedingly fond of him EOS	3685.35
SOS he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him EOS	698.40
SOS he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country EOS	5.28
SOS one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe EOS	101.17
SOS you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it EOS	1.69
SOS are not you curious to hear how it was managed EOS	2.38
SOS no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject EOS	36.65
SOS la EOS	4.00
SOS you are so strange EOS	357.14
SOS but i must tell you how it went off EOS	12.84
SOS we were married you know at st EOS	1594.57
SOS clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish EOS	61.25
SOS and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock EOS	106.82
SOS my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church EOS	17827.78
SOS well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss EOS	28.45
SOS i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted EOS	3.26
SOS and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon EOS	1845.51
SOS however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham EOS	85.26
SOS i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat EOS	37.35
SOS well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them EOS	607.51
SOS if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight EOS	36952.74
SOS not one party or scheme or any thing EOS	129.46
SOS to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open EOS	50.42
SOS well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man TITLE stone EOS	227.46
SOS and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it EOS	9.63
SOS well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day EOS	99.47
SOS but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out EOS	149.17
SOS however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for TITLE darcy might have done as well EOS	7351.13
SOS TITLE darcy EOS	13.06
SOS repeated elizabeth in utter amazement EOS	14.55
SOS oh yes EOS	14.11
SOS he was to come there with wickham you know EOS	77.27
SOS but gracious me EOS	114.11
SOS i quite forgot EOS	65.05
SOS i ought not to have said a word about it EOS	1509.31
SOS i promised them so faithfully EOS	34.72
SOS what will wickham say EOS	332.26
SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	159.04
SOS if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject EOS	122.90
SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	49.27
SOS oh EOS	98.37
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	14.54
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	14.11
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	253.34
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	4.00
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	218.38
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	1.24
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	67.51
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	119.86
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	16.24
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	1028.40
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	11.91
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	1044.21
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	6.63
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	256.81
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	14.95
SOS gracechurch street sept EOS	64.89
SOS NUM EOS	195.22
SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	52.99
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	10.30
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	14.11
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	218.61
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	16.46
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	4586.57
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	225.45
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	36.78
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	7.16
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	38.65
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	130.29
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	13.35
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	997.23
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	6.81
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	143.69
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	7.79
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	819.59
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	53.30
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	3.56
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	9.26
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	7.83
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	168.17
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	7.49
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	36.67
SOS they were in street EOS	107.73
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	78439.16
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	160.76
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	2975.52
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	7.60
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	6.45
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	131.43
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	4.50
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	28.29
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	28.95
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	71.88
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	136.56
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	39.05
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	23798.74
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	44.61
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	196.78
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	64.10
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	22.42
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	3626.84
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	13.42
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	144.01
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	48.52
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	59.37
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	8.70
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	5.59
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	9.11
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	119.68
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	1.54
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	63.91
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	1880.08
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	56.61
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	78.23
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	171.15
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	2736.24
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	2.24
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	46.20
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	24.25
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	14.07
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	320.02
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	1722.30
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	17.60
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	22.18
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	15.70
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	5.62
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	246.31
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	5426.11
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	22.97
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	58.48
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	6.60
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	75.83
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	4.28
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	6.05
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	81.10
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	57.01
SOS a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing EOS	10.40
SOS but i must write no more EOS	105.86
SOS the children have been wanting me this half hour EOS	1536.75
SOS your s very sincerely m EOS	8.05
SOS gardiner EOS	28.21
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	511.87
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	231.21
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	86.95
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	15.37
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	273.29
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	2.73
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	17.64
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	42.67
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	79.86
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	650.16
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	22.04
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	51.54
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	1418.58
SOS they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him EOS	14.11
SOS oh EOS	2.41
SOS how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him EOS	275.33
SOS for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him EOS	15.30
SOS proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself EOS	18.32
SOS she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again EOS	2308.36
SOS it was hardly enough but it pleased her EOS	3.87
SOS she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	648.20
SOS she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham EOS	5.71
SOS i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister EOS	4.84
SOS said he as he joined her EOS	14.86
SOS you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome EOS	432.32
SOS i should be sorry indeed if it were EOS	22.99
SOS we were always good friends and now we are better EOS	18348.11
SOS true EOS	261.99
SOS are the others coming out EOS	14.05
SOS i do not know EOS	173.88
SOS TITLE bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton EOS	12.25
SOS and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley EOS	21.22
SOS she replied in the affirmative EOS	11.88
SOS i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle EOS	68.47
SOS and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose EOS	11.70
SOS poor reynolds she was always very fond of me EOS	312.69
SOS but of course she did not mention my name to you EOS	4.03
SOS yes she did EOS	105.13
SOS and what did she say EOS	3249.08
SOS that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well EOS	88.27
SOS at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented EOS	11.94
SOS certainly he replied biting his lips EOS	174.13
SOS elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month EOS	23.81
SOS we passed each other several times EOS	36.76
SOS i wonder what he can be doing there EOS	116.05
SOS perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth EOS	37.36
SOS it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year EOS	21.05
SOS undoubtedly EOS	623.57
SOS did you see him while you were at lambton EOS	2.06
SOS i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had EOS	894.14
SOS yes he introduced us to his sister EOS	24.11
SOS and do you like her EOS	4103.24
SOS very much EOS	42.50
SOS i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two EOS	11.06
SOS when i last saw her she was not very promising EOS	4.09
SOS i am very glad you liked her EOS	163.95
SOS i hope she will turn out well EOS	61.07
SOS i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age EOS	90.35
SOS did you go by the village of kympton EOS	4.12
SOS i do not recollect that we did EOS	6.26
SOS i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had EOS	502.63
SOS a most delightful place EOS	30.70
SOS excellent parsonage house EOS	3499.82
SOS it would have suited me in every respect EOS	65.48
SOS how should you have liked making sermons EOS	93.84
SOS exceedingly well EOS	58.21
SOS i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing EOS	1.05
SOS one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me EOS	2540.07
SOS the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness EOS	20.38
SOS but it was not to be EOS	10.55
SOS did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent EOS	1.78
SOS i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron EOS	182.62
SOS you have EOS	663.28
SOS yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember EOS	1.85
SOS i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly EOS	78.09
SOS you did EOS	11.33
SOS and it was not wholly without foundation EOS	36.29
SOS you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it EOS	289.47
SOS they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come TITLE wickham we are brother and sister you know EOS	130.23
SOS do not let us quarrel about the past EOS	11.80
SOS in future i hope we shall be always of one mind EOS	26.54
SOS she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house EOS	776.74
SOS TITLE wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet EOS	15.08
SOS the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and TITLE bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth EOS	3.24
SOS oh EOS	3513.28
SOS my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again EOS	17.87
SOS oh lord EOS	78.91
SOS i don t know EOS	655.30
SOS not these two or three years perhaps EOS	20.90
SOS write to me very often my dear EOS	195.56

SOS but you know married women have never much time for writing EOS	98.84
SOS my sisters may write to me EOS	10.29
SOS they will have nothing else to do EOS	6.31
SOS TITLE wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s EOS	2656.81
SOS he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things EOS	20.84
SOS he is as fine a fellow said TITLE bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw EOS	3.71
SOS he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all EOS	13.35
SOS i am prodigiously proud of him EOS	878.12
SOS i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law EOS	8068.69
SOS the loss of her daughter made TITLE bennet very dull for several days EOS	2.20
SOS i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends EOS	692.88
SOS one seems so forlorn without them EOS	3.23
SOS this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth EOS	419.42
SOS it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single EOS	256.02
SOS it is no such thing EOS	2.57
SOS lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off EOS	4.58
SOS if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon EOS	640.87
SOS but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation EOS	1.45
SOS the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks EOS	3299.51
SOS TITLE bennet was quite in the fidgets EOS	16953.21

SOS well well and so TITLE bingley is coming down sister for TITLE philips first brought her the news EOS	4.55
SOS well so much the better EOS	6897.41
SOS not that i care about it though EOS	93.57
SOS he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again EOS	5.28
SOS but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it EOS	366.86
SOS and who knows what may happen EOS	529.48
SOS but that is nothing to us EOS	2.24
SOS you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it EOS	3.87
SOS and so is it quite certain he is coming EOS	4264.86
SOS you may depend on it replied the other for TITLE nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true EOS	14.53
SOS he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday EOS	10679.33
SOS she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed EOS	47.19
SOS miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour EOS	10313.94
SOS it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed EOS	913.11
SOS but don t imagine it was from any silly cause EOS	10.86
SOS i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at EOS	4.55
SOS i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain EOS	6.60
SOS i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him EOS	7.43
SOS not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks EOS	35.10
SOS elizabeth did not know what to make of it EOS	97.18
SOS had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it EOS	812.89
SOS yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation EOS	2.18
SOS i will leave him to himself EOS	145.04
SOS in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it EOS	227.10
SOS they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them EOS	401.48
SOS the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again EOS	100.39
SOS as soon as ever TITLE bingley comes my dear said TITLE bennet you will wait on him of course EOS	33.51
SOS no no EOS	8507.07
SOS you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters EOS	428.16
SOS but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again EOS	2.16
SOS his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield EOS	99.02
SOS tis an etiquette i despise said he EOS	2.84
SOS if he wants our society let him seek it EOS	92.64
SOS he knows where we live EOS	898.26
SOS i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again EOS	25.35
SOS well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him EOS	314.57
SOS but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined EOS	2207.29
SOS we must have TITLE long and the gouldings soon EOS	8.44
SOS that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him EOS	163.05
SOS consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see TITLE bingley in consequence of it before they did EOS	81.18
SOS as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister EOS	5367.94
SOS it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of EOS	25.34
SOS my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says EOS	3.75
SOS happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over EOS	32.83
SOS i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power EOS	7.89
SOS you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much EOS	355.76
SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	122.77
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	2463.42
SOS she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before EOS	3.48
SOS but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house EOS	438.25
SOS her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy EOS	33.04
SOS jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw TITLE darcy with him and sat down again by her sister EOS	4.40
SOS there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be EOS	83.76
SOS some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know EOS	201.96
SOS la EOS	114.08
SOS replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before EOS	101.32
SOS TITLE what s his name EOS	14.19
SOS that tall proud man EOS	5.36
SOS good gracious EOS	954.05
SOS TITLE darcy EOS	4.47
SOS and so it does i vow EOS	607.78
SOS well any friend of TITLE bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him EOS	1592.30
SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	6.92
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	17.17
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	1373.81
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	15433.25
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	30.49
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	196.97
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	207.82
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	1025.76
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	15.54
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	76.57
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	12.81
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	181.74
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	139.18
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	14.80
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	3.73
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	538.88
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	18.06
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	745.58
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	10.02
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	10.75
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	125.51
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	4.10
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	246.31
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	7.46
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	522.86
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	1987.76
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	716.14
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	18.02
SOS said she EOS	91.66
SOS yet why did he come EOS	6.53
SOS she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak EOS	21.81
SOS she enquired after his sister but could do no more EOS	644.87
SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	8.23
SOS he readily agreed to it EOS	38.36
SOS i began to be afraid you would never come back again EOS	5711.67
SOS people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true EOS	41.37
SOS a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away EOS	236.49
SOS miss lucas is married and settled EOS	330.51
SOS and one of my own daughters EOS	13.44
SOS i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers EOS	55.37
SOS it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be EOS	456.91
SOS it was only said lately george wickham esq EOS	54.36
SOS to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing EOS	6.10
SOS it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it EOS	85.47
SOS did you see it EOS	130.26
SOS bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations EOS	9.48
SOS elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes EOS	23.14
SOS how TITLE darcy looked therefore she could not tell EOS	1914.24
SOS it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time TITLE bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me EOS	6707.03
SOS they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long EOS	32.48
SOS his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars EOS	692.11
SOS thank heaven EOS	71.98
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	15.21
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	18.65
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	628.09
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	24.56
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	44.04
SOS i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you EOS	23613.33
SOS elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention EOS	4.77
SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	42.51
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	35.53
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	4.75
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	1170.29
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	21.34
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	143.56
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	7.34
SOS he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty EOS	3817.17
SOS jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever EOS	1.49
SOS but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent EOS	240.86
SOS when the gentlemen rose to go away TITLE bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time EOS	65.25
SOS you are quite a visit in my debt TITLE bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned EOS	49.72
SOS i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement EOS	243.83
SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	562.08
SOS they then went away EOS	698.20
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	18.82
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	4.92
SOS TITLE darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her EOS	140.99
SOS why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all EOS	105.35
SOS she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure EOS	1.78
SOS he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me EOS	6112.56
SOS if he fears me why come hither EOS	9.29
SOS if he no longer cares for me why silent EOS	223.12
SOS teazing teazing man EOS	7924.74
SOS i will think no more about him EOS	13.45
SOS her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth EOS	1289.80
SOS now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy EOS	94.13
SOS i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming EOS	42.68
SOS i am glad he dines here on tuesday EOS	38.86
SOS it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance EOS	44.95
SOS yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly EOS	677.10
SOS oh jane take care EOS	2.24
SOS my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now EOS	231.19
SOS i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever EOS	3.20
SOS they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and TITLE bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived EOS	22.37
SOS on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time EOS	124.94
SOS when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister EOS	409.04
SOS her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself EOS	163.86
SOS on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided EOS	10.51
SOS he placed himself by her EOS	29.87
SOS elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend EOS	236.28
SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	30.08
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	214.85
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	1560.21
SOS it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour EOS	9.78
SOS TITLE darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them EOS	1294.71
SOS he was on one side of her mother EOS	1.76
SOS she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage EOS	47.16
SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	1411.71
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	236.30
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	151.57
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	11.09
SOS she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend EOS	6.81
SOS if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever EOS	22.79
SOS the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas EOS	2299.92
SOS the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair EOS	8.80
SOS and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined EOS	23.57
SOS we want none of them do we EOS	2.25
SOS darcy had walked away to another part of the room EOS	346.88
SOS she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly EOS	117.59
SOS a man who has once been refused EOS	10.42
SOS how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love EOS	165.39
SOS is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman EOS	3.30
SOS there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings EOS	7146.83
SOS she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still EOS	23.99
SOS yes she will remain there till christmas EOS	1085.89
SOS and quite alone EOS	80.27
SOS have all her friends left her EOS	21.39
SOS TITLE annesley is with her EOS	3.93
SOS the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks EOS	9.11
SOS she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success EOS	42.04
SOS he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away EOS	530.19
SOS when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party EOS	1.49
SOS she now lost every expectation of pleasure EOS	666.56
SOS they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself EOS	37.73
SOS TITLE bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them EOS	32.96
SOS well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day EOS	299.20
SOS i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you EOS	194.81
SOS the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw EOS	1.55
SOS the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch EOS	42.36
SOS the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas s last week and even TITLE darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least EOS	10.58
SOS and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty EOS	25.21
SOS TITLE long said so too for i asked her whether you did not EOS	28.39
SOS and what do you think she said besides EOS	12.40
SOS ah EOS	35360.70
SOS TITLE bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last EOS	22.11
SOS she did indeed EOS	266.73
SOS i do think TITLE long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously EOS	2.11
SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	10.08
SOS it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth EOS	109.28
SOS the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other EOS	1.06
SOS i hope we may often meet again EOS	182.66
SOS elizabeth smiled EOS	84.70
SOS lizzy you must not do so EOS	2521.31
SOS you must not suspect me EOS	874.16
SOS it mortifies me EOS	86.73
SOS i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it EOS	511.13
SOS i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection EOS	1.05
SOS it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man EOS	154.20
SOS you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment EOS	46.93
SOS how hard it is in some cases to be believed EOS	70.92
SOS and how impossible in others EOS	128.96
SOS but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge EOS	1512.18
SOS that is a question which i hardly know how to answer EOS	8.78
SOS we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing EOS	42.00
SOS forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante EOS	154.55
SOS a few days after this visit TITLE bingley called again and alone EOS	21.62
SOS his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time EOS	160.66
SOS he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits EOS	35.81
SOS TITLE bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere EOS	10.63
SOS next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky EOS	241.20
SOS he should be particularly happy at any time c EOS	32.37
SOS c EOS	37.87
SOS and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them EOS	19.90
SOS can you come to morrow EOS	1.03
SOS yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity EOS	34.00
SOS he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed EOS	641.62
SOS in ran TITLE bennet to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down EOS	22.26
SOS he is come TITLE bingley is come EOS	918.96

SOS we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago EOS	1225.31
SOS oh EOS	26.90
SOS hang kitty EOS	60.72
SOS what has she to do with it EOS	793.73
SOS come be quick be quick EOS	71.92
SOS where is your sash my dear EOS	59.95
SOS but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters EOS	1185.47
SOS the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening EOS	98.48
SOS after tea TITLE bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument EOS	21.24
SOS two obstacles of the five being thus removed TITLE bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them EOS	42.76
SOS elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma EOS	160.99
SOS what do you keep winking at me for EOS	1175.43
SOS what am i to do EOS	15.70
SOS nothing child nothing EOS	46.14
SOS i did not wink at you EOS	94.27
SOS she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room EOS	6.55
SOS jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it EOS	60.23
SOS in a few minutes TITLE bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you EOS	3.59
SOS elizabeth was forced to go EOS	38.65
SOS we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall EOS	450.78
SOS kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room EOS	8.66
SOS elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room EOS	125.31
SOS TITLE bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual EOS	174.94
SOS bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter EOS	2.25
SOS his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter EOS	30.34
SOS he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and TITLE bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband EOS	59.69
SOS after this day jane said no more of her indifference EOS	2.60
SOS not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless TITLE darcy returned within the stated time EOS	23.56
SOS seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence EOS	185.59
SOS bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and TITLE bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on EOS	7.82
SOS the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected EOS	627.03
SOS there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him EOS	17.95
SOS bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening TITLE bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter EOS	14.89
SOS elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes EOS	14.81
SOS but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her EOS	31.08
SOS on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all EOS	218.13
SOS their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse EOS	7.15
SOS not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room EOS	28.68
SOS jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world EOS	108.86
SOS tis too much EOS	4.41
SOS she added by far too much EOS	148.16
SOS i do not deserve it EOS	13.89
SOS oh EOS	290.88
SOS why is not every body as happy EOS	1.70
SOS elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express EOS	4932.24
SOS every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane EOS	17.67
SOS but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present EOS	20.63
SOS i must go instantly to my mother she cried EOS	41.76
SOS i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself EOS	104.60
SOS he is gone to my father already EOS	4.46
SOS oh EOS	9.41
SOS lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family EOS	28.96
SOS how shall i bear so much happiness EOS	2.12
SOS she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty EOS	19.02
SOS elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation EOS	132.70
SOS and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection EOS	28.56
SOS of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance EOS	17.12
SOS the happiest wisest most reasonable end EOS	21.07
SOS in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose EOS	159.87
SOS where is your sister EOS	2.90
SOS said he hastily as he opened the door EOS	12.75
SOS with my mother up stairs EOS	2356.62
SOS she will be down in a moment i dare say EOS	4.07
SOS he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister EOS	24762.73
SOS elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship EOS	314.78
SOS they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself EOS	12.03
SOS it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever EOS	73.26
SOS kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon EOS	2.73
SOS TITLE bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when TITLE bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was EOS	890.24
SOS not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you EOS	21.63
SOS you will be a very happy woman EOS	310.35
SOS jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness EOS	4.85
SOS you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled EOS	2494.30
SOS i have not a doubt of your doing very well together EOS	758.58
SOS your tempers are by no means unlike EOS	3.64
SOS you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income EOS	22.19
SOS i hope not so EOS	5039.40
SOS imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me EOS	247.29
SOS exceed their income EOS	1383.32
SOS my dear TITLE bennet cried his wife what are you talking of EOS	18.55
SOS why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more EOS	5.06
SOS then addressing her daughter oh EOS	164.13
SOS my dear dear jane i am so happy EOS	400.39
SOS i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night EOS	30.83
SOS i knew how it would be EOS	147.47
SOS i always said it must be so at last EOS	20.24
SOS i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing EOS	116.44
SOS i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together EOS	516.29
SOS oh EOS	6.47
SOS he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen EOS	3313.06
SOS wickham lydia were all forgotten EOS	3.76
SOS jane was beyond competition her favourite child EOS	174.07
SOS at that moment she cared for no other EOS	57.33
SOS her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense EOS	2503.03
SOS mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter EOS	187.49
SOS bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept EOS	184.23
SOS elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur EOS	259.74
SOS in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief EOS	9.41
SOS he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring EOS	270.12
SOS i had not believed it possible EOS	133.92
SOS i suspected as much replied elizabeth EOS	38.85
SOS but how did he account for it EOS	1720.49
SOS it must have been his sister s doing EOS	2050.10
SOS they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects EOS	16.03
SOS but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other EOS	26.41
SOS that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter EOS	13.76
SOS good girl EOS	10.96
SOS it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard EOS	38.38
SOS would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again EOS	1056.94
SOS he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty EOS	8.47
SOS this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities EOS	242.29
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him EOS	6.16
SOS i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed EOS	54.35
SOS cried jane EOS	240.14
SOS oh EOS	1203.54
SOS lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all EOS	38.92
SOS if i could but see you as happy EOS	55.80
SOS if there were but such another man for you EOS	18.83
SOS if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you EOS	8.73
SOS till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness EOS	10311.94
SOS no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another TITLE collins in time EOS	22790.10
SOS the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret EOS	11.24
SOS TITLE bennet was privileged to whisper it to TITLE philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton EOS	1030.57
SOS the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune EOS	61.06
SOS one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn EOS	52.05
SOS it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours EOS	36.56
SOS the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them EOS	161.15
SOS as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery EOS	3779.33
SOS they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered EOS	21.12
SOS it was lady catherine de bourgh EOS	11.25
SOS they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of TITLE bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt EOS	9.91
SOS she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word EOS	3.06
SOS elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made EOS	15814.96
SOS TITLE bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness EOS	18.50
SOS after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet EOS	1101.57
SOS that lady i suppose is your mother EOS	160.80
SOS elizabeth replied very concisely that she was EOS	60.79
SOS and that i suppose is one of your sisters EOS	75.41
SOS yes madam said TITLE bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine EOS	80.77
SOS she is my youngest girl but one EOS	5.40
SOS my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family EOS	14.72
SOS you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence EOS	77.14
SOS it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s EOS	2.24
SOS this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west EOS	214.56
SOS TITLE bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left TITLE and TITLE collins well EOS	160.85
SOS yes very well EOS	9.67
SOS i saw them the night before last EOS	518.74
SOS elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling EOS	31.47
SOS but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled EOS	3805.40
SOS TITLE bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn EOS	1815.10
SOS i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company EOS	21.50
SOS go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks EOS	78.69
SOS i think she will be pleased with the hermitage EOS	74.47
SOS elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs EOS	18.43
SOS as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on EOS	100.80
SOS her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it EOS	312.36
SOS they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable EOS	16.26
SOS how could i ever think her like her nephew EOS	10.41
SOS said she as she looked in her face EOS	603.65
SOS as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither EOS	28.54
SOS your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come EOS	11.67
SOS elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment EOS	467.99
SOS indeed you are mistaken madam EOS	69.36
SOS i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here EOS	189.28
SOS miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with EOS	13.98
SOS but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so EOS	4006.33
SOS my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it EOS	43.48
SOS a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago EOS	3.13
SOS i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew TITLE darcy EOS	3.98
SOS though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you EOS	10.96
SOS if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far EOS	750.12
SOS what could your ladyship propose by it EOS	11.01
SOS at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted EOS	307.72
SOS your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence EOS	793.92
SOS if EOS	1.70
SOS do you then pretend to be ignorant of it EOS	1457.66
SOS has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves EOS	29.84
SOS do you not know that such a report is spread abroad EOS	26.27
SOS i never heard that it was EOS	89.07
SOS and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it EOS	271.91
SOS i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship EOS	176.57
SOS you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer EOS	2.19
SOS this is not to be borne EOS	2429.46
SOS miss bennet i insist on being satisfied EOS	21.06
SOS has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage EOS	318.29
SOS your ladyship has declared it to be impossible EOS	2.82
SOS it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason EOS	722.30
SOS but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family EOS	822.82
SOS you may have drawn him in EOS	43.47
SOS if i have i shall be the last person to confess it EOS	158.32
SOS miss bennet do you know who i am EOS	6.13
SOS i have not been accustomed to such language as this EOS	634.30
SOS i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns EOS	12.86
SOS but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit EOS	20.99
SOS let me be rightly understood EOS	30.17
SOS this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place EOS	51.19
SOS no never EOS	46.69
SOS TITLE darcy is engaged to my daughter EOS	7.51
SOS now what have you to say EOS	822.30
SOS only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me EOS	10.59
SOS lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind EOS	2209.24
SOS from their infancy they have been intended for each other EOS	42.35
SOS it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her s EOS	2493.19
SOS while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family EOS	4.43
SOS do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends EOS	25461.97
SOS to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh EOS	40.93
SOS are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy EOS	36.30
SOS have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin EOS	6.77
SOS yes and i had heard it before EOS	67.60
SOS but what is that to me EOS	455.14
SOS if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh EOS	207.21
SOS you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage EOS	71.65
SOS its completion depended on others EOS	112.45
SOS if TITLE darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice EOS	5689.31
SOS and if i am that choice why may not i accept him EOS	30.66
SOS because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it EOS	82.69
SOS yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all EOS	2.84
SOS you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him EOS	29.81
SOS your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us EOS	5.28
SOS these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth EOS	98.74
SOS but the wife of TITLE darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine EOS	3536.11
SOS obstinate headstrong girl EOS	12.49
SOS i am ashamed of you EOS	19.33
SOS is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring EOS	1792.65
SOS is nothing due to me on that score EOS	1.22
SOS let us sit down EOS	32.46
SOS you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it EOS	2694.74

SOS hear me in silence EOS	101.58
SOS my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other EOS	7805.97
SOS they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families EOS	12135.24
SOS their fortune on both sides is splendid EOS	4.65
SOS they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them EOS	23.14
SOS the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune EOS	2584.68

SOS but it must not shall not be EOS	38.05
SOS if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up EOS	6.92

SOS i will make no promise of the kind EOS	14.92

SOS i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require EOS	12.08
SOS and i certainly never shall give it EOS	1636.36
SOS i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable EOS	1.94
SOS your ladyship wants TITLE darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable EOS	872.40
SOS supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin EOS	738.92
SOS allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged EOS	2.90
SOS you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these EOS	42.42
SOS how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine EOS	2.78
SOS i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject EOS	49.52
SOS not so hasty if you please EOS	387.52
SOS i have by no means done EOS	199.12
SOS to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add EOS	7.56
SOS i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement EOS	2016.80
SOS i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles EOS	1.10
SOS and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister EOS	11.35

SOS lady catherine i have nothing farther to say EOS	1206.09
SOS you know my sentiments EOS	175.10
SOS you are then resolved to have him EOS	7.42
SOS i have said no such thing EOS	26.51
SOS i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me EOS	5.60
SOS it is well EOS	1007.02
SOS you refuse then to oblige me EOS	349.34
SOS you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude EOS	59.30
SOS you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world EOS	34.88
SOS neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance EOS	29.02
SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	15.52
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	1330.41
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	3.18
SOS this is your final resolve EOS	5685.87
SOS very well EOS	43.93

SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	31.12
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	19.11

SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	11.78
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	1457.71
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	14630.51
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	42.84
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	27.41
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	1742.81
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	16.38
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	4457.00
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	6.61
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	12.63
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	25.29
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	15.85
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	86.75
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	1.33
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	42.69
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	4.37
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	148.06
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	76889.67
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	13.95
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	421.60
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	25.28
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	16.79
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	64.06
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	118.18
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	180.12
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	20292.83
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	1420.36
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	3.94
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	577.50
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	7.14
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	176.62
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	8.24
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	43.28
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	1.47
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	43.46
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	61.39
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	117.37
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	280.73
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	135.09
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	2103.45
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	54.58
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	9.09
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	56.90
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	20.13
SOS but now it comes out EOS	28.96
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	17492.80
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	109.17
SOS mr EOS	565.81
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	4.89
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	234.62
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	1281.89
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	28.43
SOS it is admirable EOS	837.92
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	357.06
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	262.49
SOS are you not diverted EOS	67.48
SOS oh EOS	139.11
SOS yes EOS	152.24
SOS pray read on EOS	4.96
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	38.65
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	450.78
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	227.53
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	1075.67
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	932.18
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	272.55
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	7.62
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	4620.84
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	813.02
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	23.66
SOS for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn EOS	69.34
SOS oh EOS	497.98
SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	5.63
SOS but it is so strange EOS	2.63
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	61.94
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	16.97
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	38.80
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	14.12
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	1466.83
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	17.72
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	14.62
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	5.60
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	2.53
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	197.62
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	27.74
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	11.30
SOS it was agreed to EOS	137.59
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	4.66
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	42.71
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	5.70
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	41.47
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	44.03
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	304.93
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	34.70
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	3752.65
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	521.11
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	172.19
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	12.19
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	1471.76
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	72.37
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	6.65
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	62.86
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	117.56
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	521.70
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	9.26
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	557.55
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	7165.36
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	4663.20
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	458.19
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	16.05
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	5.53
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	326.68
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	1.77
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	2.11
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	17.64
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	430.70
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	2.32
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	23.14
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	324.59
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	1.09
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	120.50
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	18.56
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	13.52
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	310.01
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	24.80
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	114.42
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	26.02
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	1066.29
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	17.02
SOS those were your words EOS	16.71
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	28.84
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	1106.29
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	138.69
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	4.86
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	5.87
SOS the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me EOS	407.54
SOS oh EOS	65.13
SOS do not repeat what i then said EOS	138.19
SOS these recollections will not do at all EOS	32.60
SOS i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it EOS	19.91
SOS darcy mentioned his letter EOS	37.30
SOS did it said he did it soon make you think better of me EOS	131.75
SOS did you on reading it give any credit to its contents EOS	8.30
SOS she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed EOS	25.59
SOS i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary EOS	455.31
SOS i hope you have destroyed the letter EOS	84.57
SOS there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again EOS	12.42
SOS i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me EOS	232.12
SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	748.46
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	2.48
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	326.65
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	5.32
SOS but think no more of the letter EOS	38.65
SOS the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten EOS	130.29
SOS you must learn some of my philosophy EOS	8.85
SOS think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure EOS	89.32
SOS i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind EOS	15.01
SOS your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance EOS	4.31
SOS but with me it is not so EOS	85.10
SOS painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled EOS	125.38
SOS i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle EOS	58.31
SOS as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper EOS	3.49
SOS i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit EOS	23.14
SOS unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own EOS	126.06
SOS such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth EOS	1711.52
SOS what do i not owe you EOS	7.45
SOS you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous EOS	40.22
SOS by you i was properly humbled EOS	1.48
SOS i came to you without a doubt of my reception EOS	2747.47
SOS you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased EOS	11.94
SOS had you then persuaded yourself that i should EOS	107.62
SOS indeed i had EOS	2546.44
SOS what will you think of my vanity EOS	11.99
SOS i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses EOS	3.18
SOS my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you EOS	6.47
SOS i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong EOS	344.52
SOS how you must have hated me after that evening EOS	9.84
SOS hate you EOS	415.30
SOS i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction EOS	68.04
SOS i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley EOS	3.98
SOS you blamed me for coming EOS	1999.54
SOS no indeed i felt nothing but surprise EOS	16.67
SOS your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you EOS	108.78
SOS my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due EOS	190.98
SOS my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to EOS	4.37
SOS how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you EOS	83.76
SOS he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend EOS	48.11
SOS she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther EOS	810.61
SOS after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home EOS	37.42
SOS what could become of TITLE bingley and jane EOS	1440.73
SOS was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs EOS	3.02
SOS darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it EOS	11.37
SOS i must ask whether you were surprised EOS	23.14
SOS said elizabeth EOS	667.81
SOS not at all EOS	1.04
SOS when i went away i felt that it would soon happen EOS	83.17
SOS that is to say you had given your permission EOS	11.18
SOS i guessed as much EOS	41.98
SOS and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case EOS	5292.10
SOS on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago EOS	2.32
SOS i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent EOS	14.82
SOS his surprise was great EOS	9.25
SOS he had never had the slightest suspicion EOS	136.67
SOS i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together EOS	65.49
SOS elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend EOS	4999.06
SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	53.73
SOS from the former EOS	54.75
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	99.80
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	26.32
SOS it did EOS	3348.35
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	42.45
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	62.09
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	3915.15
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	493.30
SOS he was angry EOS	3.22
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	3000.74
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	510.49
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	33.13
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	4.03
SOS in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house EOS	52.97
SOS in the hall they parted EOS	27.62
SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	200.77
SOS was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table EOS	3516.45
SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	34.19
SOS she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth EOS	3.90
SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	4.16
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	2122.63
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	41.82
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	3798.34
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	13.39
SOS though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here EOS	977.90
SOS you are joking lizzy EOS	8.08
SOS this cannot be EOS	443.46
SOS engaged to TITLE darcy EOS	9.41
SOS no no you shall not deceive me EOS	51.40
SOS i know it to be impossible EOS	21.34
SOS this is a wretched beginning indeed EOS	19.95
SOS my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not EOS	60.98
SOS yet indeed i am in earnest EOS	15.39
SOS i speak nothing but the truth EOS	20.27
SOS he still loves me and we are engaged EOS	17.72
SOS jane looked at her doubtingly EOS	42.17
SOS oh lizzy EOS	11.88
SOS it cannot be EOS	190.63
SOS i know how much you dislike him EOS	1.76
SOS you know nothing of the matter EOS	26.74
SOS that is all to be forgot EOS	2.39
SOS perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now EOS	171.30
SOS but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable EOS	2.06
SOS this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself EOS	6.86
SOS miss bennet still looked all amazement EOS	17.52
SOS elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth EOS	244.77

SOS there can be no doubt of that EOS	6.59
SOS it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world EOS	20.34
SOS but are you pleased jane EOS	67.08
SOS shall you like to have such a brother EOS	541.23
SOS very very much EOS	3.85
SOS nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight EOS	2.61

SOS and do you really love him quite well enough EOS	29.88
SOS oh lizzy EOS	5.12
SOS do any thing rather than marry without affection EOS	1.03
SOS are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do EOS	27.84
SOS oh yes EOS	6.20
SOS you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all EOS	157.10
SOS what do you mean EOS	1129.59
SOS why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley EOS	6.24

SOS will you tell me how long you have loved him EOS	38.73
SOS it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began EOS	5.08
SOS but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley EOS	60.36
SOS another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment EOS	42.59
SOS when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish EOS	31.42
SOS now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself EOS	9.41
SOS i always had a value for him EOS	421.14
SOS were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me EOS	27.56
SOS but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me EOS	5.90
SOS how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton EOS	111.21
SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	6.04
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	31.15
SOS she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend EOS	13.75
SOS but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage EOS	12.38
SOS all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation EOS	32.86
SOS good gracious EOS	3.08
SOS cried TITLE bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable TITLE darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley EOS	14.52
SOS what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here EOS	8.54
SOS i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company EOS	308.77
SOS what shall we do with him EOS	48.52
SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	99.08
SOS elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet EOS	136.30
SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	3.84
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	494.90
SOS it is a nice long walk and TITLE darcy has never seen the view EOS	17.73
SOS it may do very well for the others replied TITLE bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty EOS	42.46
SOS wont it kitty EOS	335.71
SOS kitty owned that she had rather stay at home EOS	91.06
SOS darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented EOS	8.37
SOS as she went up stairs to get ready TITLE bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself EOS	19.94
SOS but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then EOS	6.21
SOS so do not put yourself to inconvenience EOS	882.22
SOS during their walk it was resolved that TITLE bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening EOS	1.17
SOS elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s EOS	37.57
SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	527.58
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	44.25
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	18.81
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	32.90
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	2665.96
SOS she was gone directly EOS	13.63
SOS her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious EOS	69.61
SOS lizzy said he what are you doing EOS	39.25
SOS are you out of your senses to be accepting this man EOS	1011.56
SOS have not you always hated him EOS	115.37
SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	324.12
SOS it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to TITLE darcy EOS	14.00
SOS or in other words you are determined to have him EOS	51.34
SOS he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane EOS	2.18
SOS but will they make you happy EOS	29.55
SOS have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference EOS	1.53
SOS none at all EOS	2180.88
SOS we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him EOS	1.48
SOS i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him EOS	83.67
SOS indeed he has no improper pride EOS	39.85
SOS he is perfectly amiable EOS	3.09
SOS you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms EOS	183.05
SOS lizzy said her father i have given him my consent EOS	2439.60
SOS he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask EOS	2820.46
SOS i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him EOS	9.28
SOS but let me advise you to think better of it EOS	325.18
SOS i know your disposition lizzy EOS	4.73
SOS i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior EOS	49.37
SOS your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage EOS	50.41
SOS you could scarcely escape discredit and misery EOS	1447.06
SOS my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life EOS	441.80
SOS you know not what you are about EOS	5.00
SOS elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that TITLE darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match EOS	325.18
SOS well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say EOS	4.73
SOS if this be the case he deserves you EOS	762.93
SOS i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy EOS	248.93
SOS to complete the favourable impression she then told him what TITLE darcy had voluntarily done for lydia EOS	2.47
SOS he heard her with astonishment EOS	8.53
SOS this is an evening of wonders indeed EOS	71.95
SOS and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission EOS	6.99
SOS so much the better EOS	46.01
SOS it will save me a world of trouble and economy EOS	752.83
SOS had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way EOS	6.57
SOS i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter EOS	133.16
SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	5.11
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	8.16
SOS every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time EOS	14.60
SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	3961.27
SOS its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it TITLE bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable EOS	6.22
SOS nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them EOS	31.71
SOS she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself EOS	14.81
SOS good gracious EOS	10.96
SOS lord bless me EOS	428.66
SOS only think EOS	1225.84
SOS dear me EOS	2.19
SOS TITLE darcy EOS	136.68
SOS who would have thought it EOS	7.48
SOS and is it really true EOS	20.13
SOS oh EOS	107.41
SOS my sweetest lizzy EOS	62.56
SOS how rich and how great you will be EOS	25.70
SOS what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have EOS	83.13
SOS jane s is nothing to it nothing at all EOS	698.06
SOS i am so pleased so happy EOS	17.20
SOS such a charming man EOS	76.70
SOS so handsome EOS	70.56
SOS so tall EOS	4.07
SOS oh my dear lizzy EOS	33.15
SOS pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before EOS	8.54
SOS i hope he will overlook it EOS	50.51
SOS dear dear lizzy EOS	7.34
SOS a house in town EOS	2.29

SOS three daughters married EOS	10.19
SOS ten thousand a year EOS	1880.39
SOS oh lord EOS	4.50
SOS what will become of me EOS	82.52
SOS i shall go distracted EOS	18.14
SOS this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away EOS	4.36
SOS but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her EOS	8.72
SOS my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else EOS	391.87
SOS ten thousand a year and very likely more EOS	8.32
SOS tis as good as a lord EOS	309.30
SOS and a special licence EOS	861.90
SOS you must and shall be married by a special licence EOS	25.68
SOS but my dearest love tell me what dish TITLE darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow EOS	9.62
SOS this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for EOS	1788.34
SOS but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for TITLE bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion EOS	23.13
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and TITLE bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem EOS	47.69
SOS i admire all my three sons in law highly said he EOS	105.34
SOS wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s EOS	93.36
SOS elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted TITLE darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her EOS	27.66
SOS how could you begin EOS	1253.97
SOS said she EOS	3057.52
SOS i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place EOS	10.01
SOS i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation EOS	14.86
SOS it is too long ago EOS	46.11
SOS i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun EOS	9.62
SOS my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not EOS	1788.34
SOS now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence EOS	106.27
SOS for the liveliness of your mind i did EOS	1.47
SOS you may as well call it impertinence at once EOS	53.31
SOS it was very little less EOS	9.75
SOS the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention EOS	2.32
SOS you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone EOS	325.18
SOS i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them EOS	4.73
SOS had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you EOS	14.27
SOS there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable EOS	616.49
SOS to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love EOS	21.13
SOS was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield EOS	5.46
SOS dearest jane EOS	58.86
SOS who could have done less for her EOS	5203.84
SOS but make a virtue of it by all means EOS	97.86
SOS my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last EOS	7.98
SOS what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here EOS	102.74
SOS why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me EOS	1.29
SOS because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement EOS	44.84
SOS but i was embarrassed EOS	1243.93
SOS and so was i EOS	5.26
SOS you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner EOS	14.86
SOS a man who had felt less might EOS	126.80
SOS how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it EOS	88.20
SOS but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself EOS	4.11
SOS i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you EOS	862.36
SOS my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect EOS	6.47
SOS too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject EOS	12.36
SOS this will never do EOS	212.90
SOS you need not distress yourself EOS	50.01
SOS the moral will be perfectly fair EOS	1.51
SOS lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts EOS	215.93
SOS i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude EOS	5.34
SOS i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s EOS	825.92
SOS my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing EOS	64.61
SOS lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use EOS	101.61
SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	169.10
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	61.22
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	9.79
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	2.86
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	174.46
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	722.77
SOS i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth EOS	113.03
SOS but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly EOS	5502.00
SOS and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did EOS	798.73
SOS but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected EOS	63.18
SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	56.64
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	38.09
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	80.64
SOS you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last EOS	27.96
SOS i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes EOS	597.91
SOS how could i be so silly as to wish it EOS	151.88
SOS your idea of the ponies is delightful EOS	99.66
SOS we will go round the park every day EOS	74.22
SOS i am the happiest creature in the world EOS	90.74
SOS perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice EOS	41.19
SOS i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh EOS	64.95
SOS TITLE darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me EOS	171.05
SOS you are all to come to pemberley at christmas EOS	9.05
SOS your s c EOS	19.31
SOS TITLE darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what TITLE bennet sent to TITLE collins in reply to his last EOS	1.07
SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	35.29
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	23.20
SOS console lady catherine as well as you can EOS	744.21
SOS but if i were you i would stand by the nephew EOS	27.08
SOS he has more to give EOS	287.12
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	36.64
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	32.71
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	4.71
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	343.70
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	66.23
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	1.69
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	1992.79
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	28.65
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	4.97
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	14.86
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	3100.60
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	33.13
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	11.47
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	404.35
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	29.73
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	493.17
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	335.93
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	12.43
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	2.34
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	31.08
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	251.42
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	5.20
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	6.05
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	52.03
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	274.80
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	12.04
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	3293.74
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	29.28
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	3.45
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	2.82
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	3535.41
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	12.96
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	23.14
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	126.06
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	119.05
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	177.95
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	7726.49
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	169.43
SOS any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to TITLE darcy about it if you had rather not EOS	234.78
SOS yours c EOS	1.30
SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	24.96
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	14.51
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	52.74
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	33.59
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	10.67
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	30.18
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	68.97
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	8.08
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	98.37
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	2.88
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	2357.39
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	11.06
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	30.48
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	85.07
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	5.56
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	599.02
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	35.54
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	25.76
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	336.20
