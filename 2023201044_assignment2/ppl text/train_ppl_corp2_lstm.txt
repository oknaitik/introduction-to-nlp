SOS she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she did not rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible EOS	146.70

SOS his stephen is mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink TITLE bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman is shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral EOS	282.29
SOS but how to get there was the rub EOS	95.96
SOS for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned EOS	652.89
SOS so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e . d . ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found EOS	222.39
SOS accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier is and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin is EOS	386.74
SOS but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when TITLE bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice EOS	352.52
SOS this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did EOS	247.47
SOS so bevelling around by mullett is and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus TITLE bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance EOS	279.89
SOS so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey EOS	372.82
SOS as it so happened a dublin united tramways company is sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back EOS	492.37
SOS they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station EOS	582.29
SOS between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with baird is the stonecutter is in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourke is city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable EOS	457.41
SOS bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourke is the baker is it is said EOS	443.53
SOS en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion TITLE bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you did not look out EOS	369.63
SOS highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before TITLE tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about EOS	349.73
SOS the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as TITLE bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot EOS	317.14
SOS never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes EOS	329.22
SOS another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything EOS	634.70

SOS d EOS	31.09
SOS into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically EOS	400.87
SOS most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs EOS	181.92
SOS and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind EOS	281.92
SOS discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps EOS	500.17
SOS stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox EOS	242.80
SOS he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father is gumley EOS	258.84
SOS to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge EOS	166.87
SOS someone saluted you TITLE bloom said EOS	97.36
SOS a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling night stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment EOS	619.15
SOS TITLE bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least EOS	504.98
SOS though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment is notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted EOS	506.61
SOS stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley is breath redolent of rotten cornjuice EOS	438.12
SOS lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise EOS	493.65
SOS he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer EOS	408.17
SOS his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot EOS	768.97
SOS rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen EOS	415.18
SOS this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley EOS	800.31

SOS there was a dosshouse in marlborough street TITLE maloney is but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but m conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob EOS	231.79
SOS he was starving too though he had not said a word about it EOS	82.77
SOS though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephen is feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corley is brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence EOS	265.38
SOS however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished EOS	235.77
SOS but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley is head that he was living in affluence and had not a thing to do but hand out the needful EOS	126.53
SOS whereas EOS	141.62
SOS he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing EOS	231.91
SOS a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation EOS	228.76
SOS he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact EOS	159.29

SOS being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity EOS	463.43
SOS palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether EOS	221.68
SOS in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning EOS	255.46

SOS at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest TITLE bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively everybody gets their own ration of luck they say EOS	308.92
SOS now you mention it his face was familiar to me EOS	178.15
