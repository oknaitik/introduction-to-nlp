SOS somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend is bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest EOS	1822.60

SOS but who that was the rub EOS	53414.35
SOS also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguard rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally EOS	1869.49

SOS brown robinson and co EOS	2221.58
SOS it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife EOS	1.00

SOS because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired EOS	11.38

SOS and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skin the goat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair EOS	782.53
SOS his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he did not understand one jot of what was going on EOS	6657.03
SOS funny very there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause EOS	65.05
SOS one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seaman is discharge EOS	8.35
SOS TITLE bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood EOS	24.11
SOS he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen EOS	115.13

SOS salt junk all the time EOS	124.78
SOS tired seemingly he ceased EOS	16.60
SOS his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves EOS	3.39
SOS on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings EOS	16.84
SOS and it left him wondering why EOS	236.13
SOS possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates EOS	48.31
SOS and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all EOS	429.14
SOS nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather EOS	11140.10

SOS what age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage EOS	7796.38
SOS why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny he d be about eighteen now way i figure it EOS	64.41
SOS the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor EOS	4649.60

SOS suck your blood dry they does EOS	1849.16
SOS seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner is hope and rest they had a full view of the figure NUM and a young man is sideface looking frowningly rather EOS	1348.02

SOS there he is cursing the mate EOS	776.78
SOS and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn EOS	118.92
SOS and in point of fact the young man named antonio is livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the goat who this time stretched over EOS	9838.70
SOS ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest EOS	1775.59
SOS he is gone too EOS	1003.85

SOS ate EOS	21036.67
SOS a greek he was EOS	8881.39
SOS and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio EOS	124.39
SOS the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill EOS	153.17
SOS TITLE bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink EOS	135.96
SOS his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you TITLE b EOS	92777.52
SOS and begged the chance of his washing EOS	8704.99
SOS also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing EOS	6.96
SOS still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife is undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a man is similar garments initialled with bewley and draper is marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt EOS	117664.48
SOS still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female is room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off EOS	964.18
SOS round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphy is nautical chest and then there was no more of her EOS	7.40
SOS the gunboat the keeper said EOS	38487.34
SOS it beats me TITLE bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least EOS	43.46
SOS unfortunate creature of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition EOS	7.40
SOS still no matter what the cause is from . . EOS	653.56
SOS stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade EOS	572.85
SOS fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul EOS	8912.05
SOS she is a bad merchant EOS	3728.34
SOS she buys dear and sells cheap EOS	1.00
SOS the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start EOS	2.91
SOS whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned EOS	1.15
SOS you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul EOS	42.24
SOS or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup EOS	4.21
SOS i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter EOS	12.67
SOS otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance EOS	11.11
SOS do you thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible EOS	11.86
SOS it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette EOS	12.59
SOS TITLE bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining simple i should not think that is the proper word EOS	1.50
SOS of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon EOS	40.01
SOS but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it is a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god EOS	12685.41
SOS o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence EOS	4801.08
SOS on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed EOS	28400.71
SOS has been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief EOS	8.65
SOS i am not so sure about that EOS	5790.20
SOS that is a matter for everyman is opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there EOS	1313.11
SOS my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it is the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i need not tell you EOS	1.26
SOS ca not you drink that coffee by the way let me stir it EOS	39.49
SOS and take a piece of that bun EOS	127.69
SOS it is like one of our skipper is bricks disguised EOS	13311.91
SOS still no one can give what he has not got EOS	8.83
SOS try a bit EOS	3590.61
SOS could not stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further EOS	2.97
SOS faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat TITLE bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work EOS	792.99
SOS to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders EOS	950.94
SOS on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying EOS	893.17
SOS the idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of EOS	3.06
SOS sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he could not remember when it was or where EOS	2650.22
SOS anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble is vi cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved EOS	81.79
SOS have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred EOS	101.58
SOS thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage EOS	9.19
SOS still it is solid food his good genius urged i am a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual EOS	426.16
SOS you ought to eat more solid food EOS	4068.63
SOS you would feel a different man EOS	768.06

SOS i ca not look at the point of it EOS	2.31
SOS it reminds me of roman history EOS	5353.25
SOS TITLE bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it EOS	2.55
SOS our mutual friend is stories are like himself TITLE bloom apropos of knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce EOS	2265.96
SOS do you think they are genuine he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots EOS	3747.67
SOS look at him EOS	749.47
SOS yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel EOS	25.59
SOS he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him EOS	884.57
SOS though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity EOS	1.79
SOS he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described EOS	2017.48
SOS on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera EOS	7.09
