SOS when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by TITLE darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him EOS	142.174509
SOS he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her EOS	127.573300
SOS i dare say you will find him very agreeable EOS	232.356753
SOS heaven forbid EOS	861.136456

SOS to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate EOS	295.580627
SOS do not wish me such an evil EOS	374.498076
SOS when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence EOS	122.215392
SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	110.020292
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	125.724614
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	809.398860
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	145.812007
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	185.948351
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	237.343620
SOS very well EOS	1432.530887
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	519.114222
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	114.548912
SOS but now we may be silent EOS	488.403069
SOS do you talk by rule then while you are dancing EOS	193.629860
SOS sometimes EOS	13207.388604
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	483.333612
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	124.332527
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	157.513218
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	162.236686
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	95.274120
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	125.525063
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	210.531583
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	199.518384
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	314.377291
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	155.866693
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	127.721374
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	1219.715452
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	104.732367
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	105.053189
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	132.263561
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	137.502628
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	118.216913
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	130.725713
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	263.452449
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	273.769694
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	116.395724
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	245.857312
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	246.702270
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	87.412618
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	122.342934
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	103.586271
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	152.397047
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	195.907897
SOS we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine EOS	125.152655
SOS what think you of books EOS	950.982364
SOS said he smiling EOS	1556.249280
SOS books oh EOS	1222.934952
SOS no EOS	8206.242372
SOS i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings EOS	181.156611
SOS i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject EOS	213.512845
SOS we may compare our different opinions EOS	161.905040
SOS no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else EOS	160.438147
SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	177.343028
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	473.047423
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	110.210722
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	216.515266
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	291.082603
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	325.487760
SOS i hope not EOS	964.387825
SOS it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first EOS	111.513603
SOS may i ask to what these questions tend EOS	341.330899
SOS merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity EOS	201.055521
SOS i am trying to make it out EOS	232.780527
SOS and what is your success EOS	666.976274
SOS she shook her head EOS	636.626629
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	248.548126
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	195.092799
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	120.064120
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	187.578231
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	118.027688
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	114.274295
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	94.976445
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	130.937232
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	112.480973
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	121.922340
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	162.867351
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	124.743180
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	138.927955
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	147.389433
SOS excuse my interference EOS	990.684068
SOS it was kindly meant EOS	416.483881
SOS insolent girl EOS	1093.314441
SOS said elizabeth to herself EOS	855.924610
SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	133.807780
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	175.740161
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	147.505975
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	106.444659
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	118.050457
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	191.673572
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	149.961460
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	195.653171
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	114.366149
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	111.117675
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	272.993453
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	354.862984
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	220.737967
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	288.787721
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	627.182097
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	136.316231
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	128.620668
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	124.561521
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	210.181413
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	124.204810
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	119.312281
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	184.196827
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	135.002907
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	157.885328
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	151.451725
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	158.174821
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	188.337763
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	145.079331
SOS indeed i am EOS	820.165136
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	205.331126
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	293.731059
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	129.958232
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	105.234395
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	83.427790
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	137.930514
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	90.769851
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	123.784602
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	117.834824
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	229.454461
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	111.627993
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	111.294160
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	326.310253
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	183.281104
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	301.553053
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	128.160988
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	295.581378
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	227.726489
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	139.015772
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	164.287689
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	132.676370
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	114.042800
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	95.682971
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	138.204483
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	126.163226
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	126.747513
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	98.548050
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	95.783634
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	303.200657
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	231.497589
SOS i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear EOS	137.721329
SOS for heaven s sake madam speak lower EOS	226.841177
SOS what advantage can it be to you to offend TITLE darcy EOS	293.316233
SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	252.574037
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	412.734243
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	218.386975
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	235.133282
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	114.390444
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	118.472060
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	104.137759
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	761.793735
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	142.482464
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	117.740132
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	108.308523
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	136.282832
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	1112.308285
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	193.755913
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	110.123977
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	110.638825
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	126.475989
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	308.731143
SOS let the other young ladies have time to exhibit EOS	385.879232
SOS mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good EOS	145.445498
SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	276.638270
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	106.301827
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	117.977185
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	296.793915
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	144.212032
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	133.630696
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	96.912889
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	109.891510
SOS and with a bow to TITLE darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room EOS	160.196457
SOS many stared EOS	2456.739061
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	92.910694
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	142.943208
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	125.299996
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	253.796694
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	127.048006
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	140.413212
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	156.697218
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	198.890685
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	122.141961
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	94.700361
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	169.718114
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	129.434111
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	115.307010
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	113.701358
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	431.107078

SOS TITLE bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other EOS	140.654077

SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	119.879903

SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	118.566028

SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	115.145163
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	112.774763

SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	115.051909
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	109.634492

SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	86.840544

SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	95.889352
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	114.629146

SOS though her manner varied however her determination never did EOS	196.136222
SOS TITLE collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed EOS	130.146760
SOS he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way EOS	182.919552

SOS the discussion of TITLE collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother EOS	104.119795
SOS as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence EOS	127.876073
SOS he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend EOS	134.251651
SOS the morrow produced no abatement of TITLE bennet s ill humour or ill health EOS	129.232299
SOS TITLE collins was also in the same state of angry pride EOS	185.782812

SOS i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet TITLE darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself EOS	154.159843
SOS she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her EOS	118.631552
SOS his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother EOS	149.785724
SOS soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately EOS	207.091604
SOS the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages EOS	69.365038
SOS jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs EOS	124.043622

SOS i depend on you for that EOS	751.273177
SOS to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent TITLE bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his EOS	121.065646
SOS it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country EOS	132.313215

SOS TITLE darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again EOS	155.634043

SOS i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable EOS	125.656187

SOS we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way EOS	119.160893
SOS but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend EOS	109.928303

SOS the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt EOS	191.846086
SOS it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one EOS	95.320132
SOS she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect EOS	172.210834
SOS jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart EOS	150.005842
SOS they agreed that TITLE bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together EOS	104.425386
SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	140.281353
SOS the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to TITLE collins EOS	134.630738

SOS it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express EOS	251.427945
SOS charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time EOS	179.154274
SOS this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of TITLE collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself EOS	115.739671
SOS such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon EOS	129.494013
SOS but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet EOS	120.655073
SOS he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday EOS	106.963931
SOS his reception however was of the most flattering kind EOS	284.493932
SOS miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane EOS	104.503663
SOS but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there EOS	194.350431
SOS in as short a time as TITLE collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness EOS	131.231221
SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	94.221685
SOS sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity EOS	119.748398
SOS TITLE collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair EOS	107.129267
SOS lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer TITLE bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever TITLE collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st EOS	103.970971

SOS she had gained her point and had time to consider of it EOS	273.562419

SOS but still he would be her husband EOS	614.676559
SOS without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want EOS	88.378719
SOS this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it EOS	111.757169
SOS the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person EOS	179.621029
SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	179.490671
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	144.245934
SOS a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love EOS	79.062002
SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	133.214102

SOS with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return EOS	120.113554
SOS TITLE bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him EOS	138.656593
SOS she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion EOS	116.374225
SOS but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away EOS	226.437731
SOS miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before EOS	123.004927
SOS the possibility of TITLE collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to TITLE collins EOS	101.169156

SOS do you think it incredible that TITLE collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you EOS	115.178640

SOS elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family EOS	98.561659
SOS charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard EOS	188.281727
SOS it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match EOS	150.365791

SOS elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of TITLE collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london EOS	127.281368

SOS TITLE bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter EOS	108.492484
SOS jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable EOS	182.599561

SOS elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time TITLE bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them EOS	124.378697
SOS TITLE bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity EOS	133.569959
SOS her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day EOS	130.865684
SOS TITLE bennet s best comfort was that TITLE bingley must be down again in the summer EOS	192.223100

SOS he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably EOS	177.414327
SOS thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me EOS	190.947974

SOS true said TITLE bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it EOS	146.953491
SOS TITLE wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family EOS	96.253636
SOS they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve EOS	258.219780
SOS the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on TITLE darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked TITLE darcy before they had known any thing of the matter EOS	119.980068
SOS miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else TITLE darcy was condemned as the worst of men EOS	88.144328
SOS after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity TITLE collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday EOS	146.631846
SOS the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men EOS	137.102557
SOS he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks EOS	136.638803
SOS on the following monday TITLE bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn EOS	132.243189
SOS TITLE gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education EOS	140.537711
SOS the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable EOS	113.878799
SOS TITLE gardiner who was several years younger than TITLE bennet and TITLE philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces EOS	108.359393
SOS between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard EOS	176.688544
SOS they had frequently been staying with her in town EOS	299.806455
SOS the first part of TITLE gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions EOS	156.088846
SOS when this was done she had a less active part to play EOS	324.620022
SOS it became her turn to listen EOS	556.241549
SOS TITLE bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of EOS	146.942529

SOS it is very hard to think that she might have been TITLE collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness EOS	175.788766
SOS he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him EOS	322.156025
SOS the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever EOS	188.478032
SOS the lucases are very artful people indeed sister EOS	176.685013
SOS they are all for what they can get EOS	452.930884

SOS however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves EOS	158.361963
SOS TITLE gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation EOS	166.692933
SOS when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject EOS	252.725399
SOS it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she EOS	172.257735

SOS but these things happen so often EOS	284.385039
SOS a young man such as you describe TITLE bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent EOS	89.860006
SOS an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us EOS	186.046044
SOS we do not suffer by accident EOS	529.368770
SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	104.638467
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	123.407892
SOS it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment EOS	158.196756
SOS pray how violent was TITLE bingley s love EOS	267.549790
SOS i never saw a more promising inclination EOS	261.004411
SOS he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her EOS	98.102261

SOS at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer EOS	135.811182
SOS could there be finer symptoms EOS	479.262223
SOS is not general incivility the very essence of love EOS	237.533924

SOS it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner EOS	229.331574
SOS but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us EOS	193.341257
SOS change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything EOS	185.773236
SOS elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence EOS	149.171785
SOS i hope added TITLE gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her EOS	175.320760
SOS we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her EOS	153.361534
SOS and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and TITLE darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london EOS	195.241777
SOS my dear aunt how could you think of it EOS	179.480242
SOS TITLE darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it TITLE bingley never stirs without him EOS	104.602454
SOS so much the better EOS	579.625535
SOS i hope they will not meet at all EOS	277.180782
SOS but does not jane correspond with the sister EOS	369.217828
SOS she will not be able to help calling EOS	232.092520
SOS she will drop the acquaintance entirely EOS	363.680763
SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	121.974845
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	114.067198
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	153.845762
SOS the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement EOS	162.359472
SOS TITLE bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner EOS	124.209034
SOS when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers TITLE wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions TITLE gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both EOS	125.948987
SOS without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment EOS	138.280641
SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	188.596049
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	159.125799
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	142.346316
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	148.387016
SOS here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse EOS	197.158345
SOS in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself EOS	125.548476
SOS on being made acquainted with the present TITLE darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard TITLE fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy EOS	107.763246
SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	98.141792
SOS seriously i would have you be on your guard EOS	490.234150
SOS do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent EOS	146.103751

SOS my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it EOS	142.570363
SOS my father however is partial to TITLE wickham EOS	267.301443
SOS in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist EOS	108.799190
SOS all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry EOS	286.826457
SOS i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object EOS	201.213318

SOS perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often EOS	173.332158
SOS at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him EOS	212.184874
SOS as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that EOS	168.964655
SOS but do not imagine that he is always here so often EOS	248.112316
SOS it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week EOS	175.830198
SOS you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends EOS	177.915891
SOS but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied EOS	234.869067
SOS her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented EOS	132.359267
SOS TITLE collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to TITLE bennet EOS	137.572930
SOS his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy EOS	119.463953
SOS thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room EOS	92.412832

SOS the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual EOS	134.572058
SOS elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible EOS	175.604355
SOS elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was EOS	158.276649
SOS charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen EOS	133.903157

SOS my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me EOS	103.983708

SOS she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side EOS	132.615634
SOS but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it EOS	137.845589

SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	128.894550
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	155.865906
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	129.753729
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	94.201155
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	182.147639
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	360.912402
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	391.658103
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	138.383692
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	198.775393
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	211.841492
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	161.336381
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	200.595933
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	141.968370
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	283.506269
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	146.227544
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	199.645580
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	170.996599
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	170.037045
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	222.344514
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	136.482278
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	172.785291
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	147.734917
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	188.757136
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	207.201813
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	189.099900

SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	318.754328
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	316.152226
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	151.456300
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	163.764879
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	217.044040
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	258.306499
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	150.127547
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	219.438478
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	106.139979
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	506.954435
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	146.115447
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	148.790569
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	379.646921
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	867.419389
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	108.648264
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	91.376008
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	90.832471
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	85.341340
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	404.456986
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	296.852571
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	148.543478
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	152.137253
SOS all field sports were over EOS	161.768513
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	113.928895
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	121.475693
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	112.240022
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	283.499370
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	139.294162
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	350.760933
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	268.177911
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	128.293236
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	188.122887
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	231.443273
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	113.197303
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	131.127837
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	177.183991
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	101.888082
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	115.214525
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	116.975484
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	229.240421
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	551.507023
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	88.953550
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	118.377732
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	292.810625
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	479.098747
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	195.890826
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	182.403057
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	110.592587
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	159.238469
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	174.176715
SOS are you going much farther EOS	597.420887
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	332.675036
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	203.040512
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	244.891364
SOS said she EOS	1311.663129
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	278.944939
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	499.769597
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	316.635404
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	203.039503
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	111.057561
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	239.657020
SOS but so we all do EOS	813.411579
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	160.497702
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	1436.086656
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	170.375207
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	186.530174
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	200.997255
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	159.944969
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	136.842480
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	179.660859
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	158.373138
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	206.440578
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	134.580896
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	382.776037
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	127.041808
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	101.488636
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	317.378211
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	140.223371
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	157.260977
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	176.281271
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	195.528425
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	191.582158
SOS are you indeed EOS	1412.693417
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	206.699129
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	350.875283
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	165.388426
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	123.634527
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	325.310726
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	112.195714
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	144.229788
SOS i think i have heard you say that you know them EOS	290.515638

SOS their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s EOS	176.896594
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	106.664004
SOS care of him EOS	740.822707
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	124.269372
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	169.786752
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	176.627867
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	713.553813
SOS what is it you mean EOS	765.894560
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	160.627340
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	146.033057
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	276.633998
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	129.460745
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	378.787735
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	169.184347
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	214.895433
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	209.367923
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	286.723073
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	136.396102
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	259.203443
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	178.543523
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	220.656743
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	897.025814
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	189.643104
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	134.808412
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	158.771982
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	188.726092
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	112.134976
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	95.756725
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	120.751947
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	166.746586
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	136.773695
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	109.486129
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	155.395338
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	132.528719
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	116.838216
SOS to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection EOS	311.755164
SOS all loveliness and goodness as she is EOS	354.344752

SOS neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which TITLE darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach EOS	113.598111
SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	100.655355
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	137.693573
SOS TITLE collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but TITLE collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home EOS	108.579922
SOS when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against TITLE darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent EOS	133.558332
SOS they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering EOS	94.807649
SOS but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded EOS	128.773130
SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	139.722317
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	82.833345
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	179.158853
SOS she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him EOS	136.586353
SOS while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her EOS	93.326411
SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	130.120043
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	141.518591
SOS she answered him with cold civility EOS	359.307184
SOS he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room EOS	113.985033

SOS elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression EOS	253.211484
SOS she stared coloured doubted and was silent EOS	219.320136
SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	191.193572
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	151.440946
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	121.451091
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	101.928571
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	186.825851
SOS he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand EOS	139.455306
SOS as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer EOS	221.540312
SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	182.193318
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	109.710519
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	164.775393
SOS but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly EOS	180.965334
SOS i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one EOS	148.367385
SOS it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration EOS	194.904344
SOS the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation EOS	158.378606
SOS TITLE darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise EOS	96.514781
SOS his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature EOS	149.579534
SOS he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it EOS	132.202723
SOS the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful EOS	523.472444
SOS at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting EOS	196.464065
SOS i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected EOS	190.473131
SOS but it is of small importance EOS	397.888560
SOS i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character EOS	146.583320
SOS was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil EOS	331.596017

SOS i have every reason in the world to think ill of you EOS	221.965792
SOS no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there EOS	148.214229
SOS you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind EOS	122.318803
SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	123.826346
SOS he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity EOS	248.169942
SOS can you deny that you have done it EOS	265.511559
SOS she repeated EOS	5420.677722
SOS with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success EOS	134.091911
SOS towards him i have been kinder than towards myself EOS	240.750764
SOS elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her EOS	94.528746
SOS but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded EOS	210.975118
SOS long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided EOS	344.218532
SOS your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from TITLE wickham EOS	163.001511
SOS on this subject what can you have to say EOS	307.434529
SOS in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself EOS	135.676665
SOS or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others EOS	111.948604
SOS you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour EOS	137.572839
SOS who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him EOS	168.173826
SOS his misfortunes EOS	4169.230862
SOS repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed EOS	143.128965
SOS and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy EOS	341.953495
SOS you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty EOS	142.634438
SOS you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him EOS	160.517040
SOS you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert EOS	201.009568
SOS you have done all this EOS	412.768721
SOS and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule EOS	237.785611
SOS and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me EOS	160.423753
SOS this is the estimation in which you hold me EOS	259.942194
SOS i thank you for explaining it so fully EOS	282.515611
SOS my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed EOS	105.204443
SOS but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design EOS	99.858973
SOS these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing EOS	61.447821
SOS but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence EOS	412.960699
SOS nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related EOS	478.576421
SOS they were natural and just EOS	504.411345
SOS could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections EOS	319.418993
SOS to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own EOS	126.838144
SOS elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken TITLE darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	125.643374
SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	154.872371
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	136.785555
SOS she went on EOS	1220.103663
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	113.142126
SOS you have said quite enough madam EOS	461.666650
SOS i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been EOS	275.966448
SOS forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness EOS	169.123093
SOS and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house EOS	153.175008
SOS the tumult of her mind was now painfully great EOS	215.088853
SOS she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour EOS	106.369818
SOS her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it EOS	136.291645
SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	167.594336
SOS that he should have been in love with her for so many months EOS	194.529845
SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	140.680810
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	112.369667
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	106.302263
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	114.089082
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	121.980865
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	105.748857
SOS she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of TITLE darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road EOS	112.762950
SOS the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground EOS	148.199859
SOS after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park EOS	108.554278
SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	159.200542
SOS she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being TITLE darcy she was directly retreating EOS	118.541455
SOS but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name EOS	115.595271
SOS she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be TITLE darcy she moved again towards the gate EOS	165.357736
SOS he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you EOS	132.235343
SOS will you do me the honour of reading that letter EOS	325.827869
SOS and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight EOS	185.472052
SOS with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand EOS	96.319970
SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	241.637478
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	163.757401
SOS it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you EOS	82.293724
SOS i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read EOS	122.488827
SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	157.285757
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	116.750112
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	114.510370
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	99.570387
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	102.921002
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	174.960397
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	236.663229
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	133.744433
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	194.461918
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	329.430785
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	130.378458
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	285.715951
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	159.025883
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	639.447019
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	120.306065
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	224.673258
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	209.968301
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	159.305839
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	114.491991
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	125.365212
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	174.659455
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	129.007842
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	91.702078
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	190.246332
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	103.171305
SOS pardon me EOS	933.109884
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	319.693340
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	121.638254
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	132.290375
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	218.091948
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	463.202796
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	96.322768
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	173.544522
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	343.194581
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	113.482964
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	245.743849
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	147.660330
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	206.123776
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	170.521818
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	180.561050
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	119.941828
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	189.925859
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	149.516453
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	144.460352
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	331.572174
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	202.859127
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	111.110838
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	114.535427
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	117.281014
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	110.619988
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	105.550779
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	112.017204
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	193.144588
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	104.162924
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	237.343707
SOS but whatever may be the sentiments which TITLE wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character EOS	119.750158
SOS it adds even another motive EOS	316.022403
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	116.350993
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	139.075611
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	93.638901
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	132.093753
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	157.415945
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	248.392384
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	554.774547
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	161.517815
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	268.505864
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	182.497220
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	128.685861
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	201.052504
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	198.336749
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	118.468747
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	87.361658
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	204.035037
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	289.424549
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	388.612631
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	193.083314
SOS i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being EOS	131.502041
SOS having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy EOS	236.702653
SOS my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself EOS	137.406969
SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	105.148881
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	167.606768
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	115.436877
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	349.786228
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	140.234140
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	98.503721
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	201.299392
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	95.427239
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	172.806574
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	139.115258
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	166.295620
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	250.882971
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	105.328037
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	112.628144
SOS i will only add god bless you EOS	113.161183
SOS fitzwilliam darcy EOS	1932.205426
SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	179.885658
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	186.684574
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	465.573959
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	174.378149
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	153.899214
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	146.151874
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	160.368688
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	201.802306
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	490.474770
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	95.872030
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	119.381091
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	132.884066
SOS this cannot be EOS	778.124599
SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	344.739993
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	122.095210
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	123.882670
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	142.951552
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	190.125223
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	141.440473
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	111.431740
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	117.887398
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	315.485658
SOS again she read on EOS	715.704322
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	102.292726
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	133.852754
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	124.755371
SOS of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself EOS	277.046811
SOS as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring EOS	211.606322
SOS his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue EOS	213.042195

SOS their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter TITLE bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her EOS	95.086361
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun EOS	278.424952
SOS as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too EOS	117.002489

SOS to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures EOS	165.005228

SOS it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers EOS	203.355112
SOS there was another reason too for her opposition EOS	338.317301
SOS she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible EOS	212.911404

SOS she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents EOS	130.774644
SOS elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last EOS	87.681166
SOS elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	116.312909
SOS miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings EOS	105.074554
SOS she was sorry that TITLE darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him EOS	130.964401
SOS his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment EOS	192.365014

SOS but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day EOS	256.683583
SOS she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham EOS	120.340175
SOS what a stroke was this for poor jane EOS	327.593601
SOS who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual EOS	95.549690
SOS nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery EOS	178.999346

SOS this will not do said elizabeth EOS	476.615429
SOS you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing EOS	240.401237

SOS for my part i am inclined to believe it all TITLE darcy s but you shall do as you chuse EOS	238.127642

SOS poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance EOS	224.981533
SOS such an openness and gentleness in his manner EOS	293.466220
SOS there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men EOS	182.167147
SOS one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it EOS	240.840582
SOS i never thought TITLE darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do EOS	214.230866
SOS and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason EOS	172.329740
SOS it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind EOS	149.842752
SOS one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty EOS	118.395781
SOS lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now EOS	181.109383
SOS indeed i could not EOS	570.692352
SOS i was uncomfortable enough EOS	527.842148
SOS i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy EOS	340.650238
SOS and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had EOS	210.049189
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS how i wanted you EOS	658.272550
SOS how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to TITLE darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved EOS	159.069222
SOS certainly EOS	13207.388604
SOS but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging EOS	190.976674
SOS there is one point on which i want your advice EOS	263.819869
SOS i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character EOS	153.068595
SOS miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully EOS	109.792181
SOS what is your own opinion EOS	487.627356
SOS that it ought not to be attempted EOS	537.273309
SOS TITLE darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public EOS	193.859709
SOS on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me EOS	113.238692
SOS the general prejudice against TITLE darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light EOS	147.927383
SOS i am not equal to it EOS	242.720683
SOS wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is EOS	178.889657
SOS sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before EOS	124.755632
SOS at present i will say nothing about it EOS	252.487918
SOS you are quite right EOS	413.965290
SOS to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever EOS	185.446424
SOS he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character EOS	136.183124
SOS we must not make him desperate EOS	444.278240
SOS the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation EOS	189.542395
SOS she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either EOS	153.200452
SOS but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure EOS	102.752193
SOS she dared not relate the other half of TITLE darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend EOS	121.379935
SOS here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery EOS	117.613692
SOS and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself EOS	157.466489
SOS the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value EOS	177.729488
SOS she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits EOS	132.865288
SOS jane was not happy EOS	1162.768642
SOS she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley EOS	203.803693
SOS having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity EOS	112.409583
SOS well lizzy said TITLE bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s EOS	156.302773
SOS for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody EOS	302.069257
SOS i told my sister philips so the other day EOS	307.647385
SOS but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london EOS	163.788217
SOS well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now EOS	143.738308
SOS there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know EOS	152.280065
SOS i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more EOS	179.213420
SOS oh well EOS	2140.834503
SOS it is just as he chooses EOS	454.862018
SOS nobody wants him to come EOS	360.255367
SOS though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it EOS	184.586289
SOS well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done EOS	145.725314
SOS but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer EOS	198.752199
SOS well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they EOS	166.421051
SOS well well i only hope it will last EOS	414.198767

SOS well much good may it do them EOS	618.949103
SOS and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead EOS	207.696121
SOS they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens EOS	211.322734
SOS it was a subject which they could not mention before me EOS	211.638499
SOS no EOS	8206.242372

SOS it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace EOS	154.308799
SOS the dejection was almost universal EOS	563.995099
SOS the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments EOS	103.717221
SOS very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family EOS	111.504968
SOS good heaven EOS	1525.608123
SOS what is to become of us EOS	333.031935

SOS such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house EOS	92.458774
SOS elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame EOS	254.743017
SOS she felt anew the justice of TITLE darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend EOS	140.326028
SOS but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from TITLE forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton EOS	149.318211
SOS this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married EOS	179.597901
SOS a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two EOS	150.887748
SOS the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of TITLE forster the delight of TITLE bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described EOS	188.534131
SOS wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish EOS	80.674758
SOS i cannot see why TITLE forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend EOS	183.083370
SOS i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older EOS	231.635363
SOS in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned EOS	216.097216
SOS as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go EOS	132.581023
SOS she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as TITLE forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home EOS	129.443711
SOS he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances EOS	136.423906
SOS if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair EOS	106.865389

SOS if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment EOS	135.364918

SOS colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body EOS	135.422090

SOS she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once EOS	56.626295

SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	113.257868

SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	106.424691
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	135.650815
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	142.904390

SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	109.673499
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	161.384743
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	168.897222

SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	143.737798
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	75.212072
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	146.298667
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	165.224781
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	92.105213
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	75.152892
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	102.969712
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	111.702100
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	132.411065
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	170.617323
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	132.371165
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	123.565738
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	138.798599
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	115.318588
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	272.743748
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	169.113609
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	120.225049
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	275.755814
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	451.914861
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	137.106837
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	105.934190
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	291.299887
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	203.393650
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	139.638044
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	95.283095
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	133.144878
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	288.589550
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	209.221074
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	776.307807

SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	78.171224
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	99.643600
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	229.274838
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	243.535572
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	127.857325
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	141.861055
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	166.164231
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	259.607268
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	121.054530
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	144.807519
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	204.547273
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	159.405163
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	190.466655
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	306.551171
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	275.472229
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	139.218242
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	195.280668
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	279.947012
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	175.768474
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	110.248447
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	90.142777
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	113.202633
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	116.478003
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	150.798820
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	128.206223
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	187.647569
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	178.085863
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	246.616091
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	171.915854
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	654.400412
SOS to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good EOS	182.684339
SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	330.558397
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	130.834857
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	190.482166
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	152.214686
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	227.282510
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	174.762975
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	242.657936
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	145.417946
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	186.283646
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	175.706693
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	140.238262
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	177.401286
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	124.958741
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	104.357143
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	105.166186
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	111.827756
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	168.556091
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	168.985473
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	156.188224
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	131.589041
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	113.532941
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	167.749390
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	146.499207
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	83.979386
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	93.476381
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	112.570571
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	149.956021
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	212.340783
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	142.416041
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	233.134649
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	135.451812
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	168.727800
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	126.122677
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	127.055412
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	135.641802
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	146.684311
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	171.878950
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	287.821730
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	161.218689
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	112.403939
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	201.540393
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	499.120512
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	142.325700
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	247.089185
SOS in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh EOS	197.483231
SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	213.141983
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	152.552341
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	143.362645
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	155.018452
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	192.772346
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	113.525627
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	164.178132
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	138.680408
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	136.253431
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	168.554118
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	92.046943
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	102.962294
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	118.814916
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	105.576119
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	121.275389
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	115.187980
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	98.140974
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	152.977201
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	132.631778
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	122.154166
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	152.071827
SOS it was evident that she was much better acquainted with TITLE darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her EOS	132.825373
SOS they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry EOS	279.775665
SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	182.431519
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	134.996556
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	107.500803
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	144.293766
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	165.476524
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	190.936604
SOS with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which TITLE darcy afterwards discharged EOS	111.792093
SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	138.674940
SOS she certainly did not hate him EOS	452.507889
SOS no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called EOS	147.126179
SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	103.808188
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	199.662343
SOS it was gratitude EOS	1202.418744

SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	120.090070

SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	240.796995
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	131.661638
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	89.035493
SOS though lydia had never been a favourite with them TITLE and TITLE gardiner could not but be deeply affected EOS	178.097920
SOS not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror TITLE gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power EOS	162.135818
SOS elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled EOS	106.000476
SOS they were to be off as soon as possible EOS	180.575770

SOS yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement EOS	166.911796
SOS that is all settled EOS	739.250749

SOS and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth EOS	269.961351
SOS oh that i knew how it was EOS	378.935118
SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	175.165017
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	132.887931
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	118.382735
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	145.469419
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	100.412555
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	322.700665
SOS could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster EOS	167.863267
SOS his temptation is not adequate to the risk EOS	420.114467
SOS do you really think so EOS	368.058197
SOS cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment EOS	155.104535
SOS upon my word said TITLE gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion EOS	184.972599
SOS it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it EOS	111.829862
SOS i cannot think so very ill of wickham EOS	247.312322
SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	152.462070
SOS not perhaps of neglecting his own interest EOS	425.379196
SOS but of every other neglect i can believe him capable EOS	313.721214
SOS if indeed it should be so EOS	435.815319
SOS but i dare not hope it EOS	317.646561
SOS why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case EOS	247.042098
SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	134.926201
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	148.951249
SOS and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road EOS	220.944415
SOS well then supposing them to be in london EOS	258.232833
SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	204.575230
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	110.904624
SOS but why all this secrecy EOS	594.977490
SOS why any fear of detection EOS	534.181604
SOS why must their marriage be private EOS	553.157113
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS no no this is not likely EOS	567.473172
SOS his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her EOS	182.701343
SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	277.156653
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	500.495591
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	100.444312
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	140.925842
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	189.972542
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	183.469794
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	222.367768
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	135.841197
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	368.200015
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	383.392458
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	157.711922
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	148.827702
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	149.406501
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	148.139490
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	181.860612
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	185.799066
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	219.866215
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	428.091198
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	161.368763
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	196.428568
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	225.077402
SOS that he has neither integrity nor honour EOS	175.734593
SOS that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating EOS	276.159157
SOS and do you really know all this EOS	390.189598
SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	217.237789
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	342.220960
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	129.973062
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	141.465305
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	134.823958
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	408.971026
SOS he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her EOS	221.270928
SOS but does lydia know nothing of this EOS	401.121164
SOS can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand EOS	336.541780
SOS oh yes EOS	705.261792
SOS that that is the worst of all EOS	617.741193
SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	184.657475
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	233.820258
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	185.922200
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	145.621108
SOS that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head EOS	241.790882
SOS that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts EOS	212.290570
SOS when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other EOS	154.238508
SOS not the slightest EOS	3151.943697
SOS i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away EOS	126.766994
SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	189.542604
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	120.535134
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	116.551866
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	517.789357
SOS fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness EOS	136.034810
SOS they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day EOS	95.175134
SOS it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations EOS	173.377160
SOS the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome EOS	84.281022
SOS elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her EOS	68.648954
SOS elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives EOS	136.346053
SOS not yet replied jane EOS	672.722589
SOS but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well EOS	279.043871
SOS is my father in town EOS	794.489555
SOS yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word EOS	282.343360
SOS and have you heard from him often EOS	595.817258
SOS we have heard only once EOS	425.956252
SOS he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do EOS	127.971749
SOS he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention EOS	196.488000
SOS and my mother how is she EOS	763.779520
SOS how are you all EOS	740.649763

SOS you look pale EOS	1360.205415
SOS how much you must have gone through EOS	314.976023
SOS her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while TITLE and TITLE gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party EOS	132.669713
SOS jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears EOS	117.805280
SOS when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give EOS	146.668085
SOS the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage EOS	130.860421
SOS TITLE bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing EOS	73.158799
SOS if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her EOS	155.213725
SOS why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight EOS	200.723511
SOS i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after EOS	161.215644
SOS i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am EOS	217.302449
SOS poor dear child EOS	817.289822
SOS and now here s TITLE bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all EOS	152.018625
SOS the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do EOS	142.821449
SOS they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and TITLE gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist TITLE bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia EOS	118.133988
SOS do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain EOS	158.570010
SOS it is not quite a week since they left brighton EOS	175.230784
SOS in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost EOS	135.368731
SOS as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done EOS	136.035525
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS my dear brother replied TITLE bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for EOS	190.943561
SOS and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry EOS	181.581555
SOS and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married EOS	173.901069
SOS and above all things keep TITLE bennet from fighting EOS	290.988881
SOS tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day EOS	119.005870
SOS and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses EOS	190.320469
SOS oh brother how kind you are EOS	406.382694
SOS i know you will contrive it all EOS	295.769355
SOS but TITLE gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters EOS	155.855964
SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	116.672979
SOS in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before EOS	97.574287
SOS one came from her books and the other from her toilette EOS	422.086532
SOS the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty EOS	120.959251
SOS as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of EOS	136.242290
SOS but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation EOS	80.441180
SOS then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex EOS	105.900706
SOS elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply EOS	150.701807
SOS mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them EOS	114.867211
SOS in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy EOS	107.525227
SOS after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard EOS	133.346223

SOS i am so grieved for him EOS	212.150106
SOS his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost EOS	416.502735
SOS he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey EOS	138.655981
SOS and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry EOS	395.370797
SOS did he know of their intending to go off EOS	395.098501
SOS had colonel forster seen denny himself EOS	241.941993
SOS yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it EOS	100.014750
SOS he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before EOS	139.056886
SOS and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married EOS	185.320235
SOS how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains EOS	215.654291
SOS i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right EOS	163.942184
SOS my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be EOS	173.881138
SOS kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step EOS	153.659794

SOS i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did EOS	195.137930
SOS he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant EOS	405.070747
SOS and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false EOS	149.722090
SOS oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened EOS	213.238971
SOS perhaps it would have been better replied her sister EOS	225.615712
SOS but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable EOS	150.931588

SOS the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this EOS	149.398212
SOS and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and TITLE bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age EOS	106.188599
SOS howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by TITLE collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair EOS	137.615424
SOS they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family EOS	108.103982
SOS and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace EOS	111.542773

SOS it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living EOS	131.262380
SOS his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them EOS	135.618818
SOS there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him EOS	148.045135
SOS and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount EOS	95.455109

SOS TITLE bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him EOS	111.839534
SOS he now wished it more than ever EOS	431.177260
SOS had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her EOS	164.034515
SOS the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place EOS	113.076916
SOS he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could EOS	124.558498
SOS when first TITLE bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son EOS	186.371433
SOS this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for EOS	131.975758

SOS this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving EOS	264.600617

SOS five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on TITLE bennet and the children EOS	130.150103
SOS but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents EOS	173.059703
SOS this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and TITLE bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him EOS	164.972471
SOS in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him EOS	110.531762
SOS he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement EOS	162.545967
SOS he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum EOS	130.530095
SOS that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible EOS	146.646833
SOS when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence EOS	134.880239

SOS the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood EOS	82.562397
SOS it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy EOS	199.478997
SOS to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house EOS	108.598553
SOS but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain EOS	147.467358
SOS it was a fortnight since TITLE bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high EOS	142.360037
SOS no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph EOS	244.601971
SOS the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants EOS	102.167146
SOS she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance EOS	98.338920
SOS haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off EOS	100.642312
SOS i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful EOS	150.220049
SOS her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained EOS	192.949614

SOS into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance EOS	342.854490
SOS i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn EOS	159.141857
SOS a long dispute followed this declaration but TITLE bennet was firm it soon led to another and TITLE bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter EOS	106.179091
SOS he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion EOS	178.609596
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly comprehend it EOS	187.369436
SOS that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible EOS	105.712765
SOS she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place EOS	123.870299
SOS elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make TITLE darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot EOS	137.551195
SOS she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means EOS	143.709178
SOS there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much EOS	100.860338
SOS not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them EOS	111.896647
SOS had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that TITLE darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned EOS	118.088756
SOS from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink EOS	254.936779
SOS the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this EOS	140.000121
SOS she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what EOS	178.602486

SOS what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received EOS	108.670990
SOS he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex EOS	314.290665
SOS but while he was mortal there must be a triumph EOS	315.562499
SOS she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her EOS	168.747364
SOS his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes EOS	192.050492
SOS it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance EOS	123.758181
SOS but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was EOS	79.808515
SOS an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family EOS	190.942782
SOS how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine EOS	200.173286

SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	138.836507

SOS TITLE darcy EOS	619.406064
SOS repeated elizabeth in utter amazement EOS	405.408585
SOS oh yes EOS	705.261792
SOS he was to come there with wickham you know EOS	363.217778
SOS but gracious me EOS	940.854703
SOS i quite forgot EOS	1853.201046
SOS i ought not to have said a word about it EOS	265.428253
SOS i promised them so faithfully EOS	800.753443
SOS what will wickham say EOS	930.510408
SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	441.917476
SOS if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject EOS	193.274814
SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	148.141053
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	195.525237
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	248.989687
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	156.391375
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	181.952390
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	241.035227
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	142.641801
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	135.216506
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	146.620600
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	91.873549
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	131.519221
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	129.754942
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	135.187710
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	146.797145
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	170.680777
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	130.528504
SOS gracechurch street sept EOS	309.157814
SOS NUM EOS	16172.826337
SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	115.064857
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	138.998405
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	145.580009
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	148.285275
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	192.246210
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	216.481598
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	186.719308
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	213.376062
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	141.813149
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	174.757252
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	141.512177
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	121.738678
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	115.631256
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	639.412758
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	138.748854
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	130.319146
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	152.440041
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	133.784600
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	99.977992
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	181.263534
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	199.540585
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	152.088219
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	157.583656
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	137.467058
SOS they were in street EOS	817.328688
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	224.525463
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	133.605135
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	135.562084
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	221.888177
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	159.824979
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	188.405741
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	109.432843
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	126.228744
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	173.412590
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	216.128816
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	155.212153
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	147.522368
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	153.661130
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	256.289920
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	224.918453
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	133.537794
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	141.671160
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	116.091289
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	205.893809
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	471.505358
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	186.686831
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	230.658974
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	135.565015
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	518.972759
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	162.329839
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	125.865933
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	145.857701
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	197.983235
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	107.104715
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	231.865997
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	212.724753
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	107.569165
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	213.709500
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	128.919038
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	150.200595
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	111.390596
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	138.285927
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	298.558230
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	173.516640
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	237.678867
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	147.177596
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	176.864063
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	204.244795
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	152.623650
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	218.429698
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	186.614959
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	142.904740
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	210.714010
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	121.214980
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	198.267287
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	443.503847
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	104.203906
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	186.743257
SOS a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing EOS	131.513529
SOS but i must write no more EOS	313.747765
SOS the children have been wanting me this half hour EOS	282.130304
SOS your s very sincerely m EOS	456.420226
SOS gardiner EOS	9339.034043
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	128.280057
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	107.216139
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	110.375659
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	171.396654
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	216.523548
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	107.541393
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	532.063188
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	267.110712
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	412.735425
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	344.576674
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	173.506685
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	122.653799
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	130.331052
SOS they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him EOS	216.318443
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him EOS	67.291048
SOS for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him EOS	289.621618
SOS proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself EOS	202.799635
SOS she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again EOS	256.612129
SOS it was hardly enough but it pleased her EOS	314.079831
SOS she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	108.253522
SOS she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham EOS	126.605925
SOS i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister EOS	80.009255
SOS said he as he joined her EOS	495.485930
SOS you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome EOS	243.390177

SOS that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well EOS	208.407822
SOS at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented EOS	191.181398
SOS certainly he replied biting his lips EOS	275.181646
SOS elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month EOS	192.319170
SOS we passed each other several times EOS	264.369422
SOS i wonder what he can be doing there EOS	351.651115

SOS yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember EOS	318.497124
SOS i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly EOS	135.794231

SOS and it was not wholly without foundation EOS	325.043339

SOS but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation EOS	136.455168

SOS but don t imagine it was from any silly cause EOS	192.882396
SOS i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at EOS	200.801152
SOS i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain EOS	160.701245
SOS i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him EOS	143.316963
SOS not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks EOS	186.431611
SOS elizabeth did not know what to make of it EOS	265.790366
SOS had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it EOS	129.260736
SOS yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation EOS	128.785907
SOS i will leave him to himself EOS	607.168722
SOS in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it EOS	138.150412
SOS they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them EOS	129.497806
SOS the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again EOS	93.869613
SOS as soon as ever TITLE bingley comes my dear said TITLE bennet you will wait on him of course EOS	165.466355
SOS no no EOS	2164.680064
SOS you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters EOS	190.008158
SOS but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again EOS	145.248771
SOS his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield EOS	148.141526
SOS tis an etiquette i despise said he EOS	123.145771
SOS if he wants our society let him seek it EOS	149.427736
SOS he knows where we live EOS	390.282695
SOS i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again EOS	133.212577
SOS well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him EOS	166.460196
SOS but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined EOS	124.050952
SOS we must have TITLE long and the gouldings soon EOS	329.117384
SOS that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him EOS	158.745699
SOS consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see TITLE bingley in consequence of it before they did EOS	158.941629
SOS as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister EOS	186.271309
SOS it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of EOS	112.815532
SOS my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says EOS	167.887830
SOS happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over EOS	378.559361
SOS i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power EOS	201.698492
SOS you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much EOS	128.390996
SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	1205.231028
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	138.970672
SOS she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before EOS	135.032786
SOS but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house EOS	103.031626
SOS her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy EOS	261.322892
SOS jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw TITLE darcy with him and sat down again by her sister EOS	150.922541
SOS there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be EOS	192.930526
SOS some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know EOS	138.666449

SOS TITLE darcy EOS	619.406064
SOS and so it does i vow EOS	844.001436
SOS well any friend of TITLE bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him EOS	175.253727
SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	408.760486
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	140.652297
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	272.569644
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	182.001031
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	114.151499
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	133.351215
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	133.974212
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	128.624588
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	529.348194
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	165.567111
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	104.337231
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	125.823043
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	88.212994
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	179.515786
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	224.182679
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	153.220897
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	180.400865
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	242.300283
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	183.674709
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	124.986923
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	118.245423
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	140.284708
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	261.317829
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	390.884686
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	123.958281
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	146.227472
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	272.310297
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	647.471937
SOS said she EOS	1311.663129
SOS yet why did he come EOS	453.402184
SOS she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak EOS	212.063729
SOS she enquired after his sister but could do no more EOS	332.677191
SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	148.349379
SOS he readily agreed to it EOS	364.551539
SOS i began to be afraid you would never come back again EOS	262.898687
SOS people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true EOS	164.966502
SOS a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away EOS	116.918882
SOS miss lucas is married and settled EOS	499.640666
SOS and one of my own daughters EOS	767.961341
SOS i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers EOS	310.605002
SOS it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be EOS	217.104244
SOS it was only said lately george wickham esq EOS	176.673633
SOS to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing EOS	194.838265
SOS it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it EOS	143.657915
SOS did you see it EOS	642.793716
SOS bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations EOS	464.677780
SOS elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes EOS	204.983181
SOS how TITLE darcy looked therefore she could not tell EOS	275.811252
SOS it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time TITLE bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me EOS	142.439542
SOS they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long EOS	133.977745
SOS his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars EOS	216.951546
SOS thank heaven EOS	855.684809
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	294.855913
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	163.078271
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	160.806075
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	425.806807
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	148.087093
SOS i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you EOS	119.123019
SOS elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention EOS	114.199816
SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	129.070259
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	158.197455
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	244.867172
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	127.709617
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	245.804070
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	97.818157
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	263.326827
SOS he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty EOS	177.175875
SOS jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever EOS	204.136773
SOS but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent EOS	208.146434
SOS when the gentlemen rose to go away TITLE bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time EOS	112.095449
SOS you are quite a visit in my debt TITLE bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned EOS	145.222073
SOS i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement EOS	172.755234
SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	164.214432
SOS they then went away EOS	419.681616
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	111.848925
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	90.872476
SOS TITLE darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her EOS	146.070912
SOS why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all EOS	188.019216
SOS she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure EOS	366.201422
SOS he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me EOS	201.747768
SOS if he fears me why come hither EOS	259.882402
SOS if he no longer cares for me why silent EOS	211.203663
SOS teazing teazing man EOS	254.277524
SOS i will think no more about him EOS	328.617813
SOS her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth EOS	122.714912
SOS now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy EOS	259.360209
SOS i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming EOS	193.110062
SOS i am glad he dines here on tuesday EOS	126.874113
SOS it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance EOS	132.521987
SOS yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly EOS	271.833618
SOS oh jane take care EOS	527.836860
SOS my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now EOS	154.907715
SOS i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever EOS	208.718741
SOS they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and TITLE bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived EOS	133.017953
SOS on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time EOS	107.615648
SOS when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister EOS	128.042406
SOS her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself EOS	104.910160
SOS on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided EOS	191.865689
SOS he placed himself by her EOS	399.059538
SOS elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend EOS	152.058921
SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	109.748195
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	136.705197
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	159.757581
SOS it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour EOS	215.960440
SOS TITLE darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them EOS	190.755546
SOS he was on one side of her mother EOS	300.338532
SOS she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage EOS	199.545677
SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	135.217638
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	111.996673
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	98.702666
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	153.353011
SOS she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend EOS	220.148862
SOS if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever EOS	196.467887
SOS the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas EOS	202.950830
SOS the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair EOS	106.851208
SOS and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined EOS	127.352821
SOS we want none of them do we EOS	374.199844
SOS darcy had walked away to another part of the room EOS	231.009526
SOS she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly EOS	117.699987
SOS a man who has once been refused EOS	320.399510
SOS how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love EOS	198.521407
SOS is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman EOS	150.482778
SOS there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings EOS	152.732979
SOS she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still EOS	108.601022
SOS yes she will remain there till christmas EOS	284.358424
SOS and quite alone EOS	2025.144151

SOS she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success EOS	202.887639
SOS he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away EOS	195.458866
SOS when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party EOS	84.675007
SOS she now lost every expectation of pleasure EOS	385.082173
SOS they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself EOS	136.828373
SOS TITLE bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them EOS	109.416351

SOS and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty EOS	234.635949

SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	171.034786
SOS it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth EOS	248.905754

SOS bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter EOS	170.664336
SOS his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter EOS	120.921706
SOS he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and TITLE bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband EOS	99.631969

SOS but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her EOS	143.016883
SOS on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all EOS	124.377155
SOS their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse EOS	334.132992

SOS they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself EOS	119.805633
SOS it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever EOS	107.398004
SOS kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon EOS	176.694953
SOS TITLE bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when TITLE bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was EOS	100.456221
SOS not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you EOS	146.899720

SOS mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter EOS	122.574587
SOS bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept EOS	86.865589
SOS elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur EOS	147.317930

SOS he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty EOS	271.908218
SOS this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities EOS	145.892352
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him EOS	115.648814

SOS and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement EOS	276.909014
SOS i will make no promise of the kind EOS	345.255706
SOS miss bennet i am shocked and astonished EOS	347.771088

SOS but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede EOS	225.740761
SOS i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require EOS	220.840483
SOS and i certainly never shall give it EOS	441.258446
SOS i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable EOS	99.594714
SOS your ladyship wants TITLE darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable EOS	191.069212
SOS supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin EOS	195.082528
SOS allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged EOS	140.270514
SOS you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these EOS	142.728211
SOS how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine EOS	153.286188
SOS i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject EOS	151.506060
SOS not so hasty if you please EOS	458.411592
SOS i have by no means done EOS	344.891851
SOS to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add EOS	251.040871
SOS i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement EOS	157.701894
SOS i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles EOS	185.206509
SOS and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister EOS	365.905451
SOS is her husband is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother EOS	274.703961
SOS heaven and earth EOS	1382.822583
SOS of what are you thinking EOS	857.052778
SOS are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted EOS	350.585188

SOS lady catherine i have nothing farther to say EOS	181.208911
SOS you know my sentiments EOS	784.366492
SOS you are then resolved to have him EOS	372.458895
SOS i have said no such thing EOS	475.678472
SOS i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me EOS	121.703226
SOS it is well EOS	1021.963494
SOS you refuse then to oblige me EOS	317.343690
SOS you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude EOS	208.600470
SOS you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world EOS	185.353290
SOS neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance EOS	136.392400
SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	181.029402
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	182.834252
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	483.806435
SOS this is your final resolve EOS	252.116628
SOS very well EOS	1432.530887
SOS i shall now know how to act EOS	409.715528
SOS do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified EOS	169.405627
SOS i came to try you EOS	562.883558
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	190.014210
SOS in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet EOS	140.694258
SOS i send no compliments to your mother EOS	367.693884
SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	520.546539
SOS i am most seriously displeased EOS	278.371567
SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	105.745598
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	197.556540
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	163.622090
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	302.540743
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	220.287643
SOS and her calling here was prodigiously civil EOS	343.919708
SOS for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well EOS	274.917411
SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	130.656065
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	381.425918
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	150.857154
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	119.286506
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	100.296815
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	207.840706
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	168.124048
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	181.480176
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	129.183685
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	105.036464
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	149.548706
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	133.328558
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	109.635007
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	118.918918
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	390.572832
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	188.483537
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	128.054972
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	232.098856
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	108.075421
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	120.061686
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	193.074461
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	293.658943
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	176.558467
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	146.590269
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	211.233436
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	235.939527
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	168.521173
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	206.272897
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	219.686338
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	128.193170
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	111.588394
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	435.810847
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	946.765148
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	571.971555
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	387.347463
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	126.896006
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	171.594485
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	363.371372
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	110.922074
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	120.901733
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	155.676378
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	79.033022
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	85.946794
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	284.059312
SOS but now it comes out EOS	502.884271
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	325.757700
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	125.021690
SOS mr EOS	16172.826337
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	883.600691
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	376.777599
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	131.389205
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	182.949791
SOS it is admirable EOS	1098.122776
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	114.928210
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	184.649334
SOS are you not diverted EOS	1172.241364
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes EOS	9475.752486
SOS pray read on EOS	452.789490
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	125.023085
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	147.400899
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	90.281939
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	98.863283
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	160.496389
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	175.966850
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	296.904197
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	167.072912
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	217.253018
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	135.434125
SOS for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn EOS	199.552659
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	251.883303
SOS but it is so strange EOS	567.871696
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	442.741749
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	128.699000
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	143.549768
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	146.931714
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	273.360358
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	514.488513
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	182.918701
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	181.607270
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	249.765747
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	114.426980
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	168.219374
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	135.291258
SOS it was agreed to EOS	362.570302
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	94.139008
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	231.845871
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	134.142414
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	152.632707
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	118.222689
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	145.746828
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	132.954372
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	174.043790
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	218.968346
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	139.022188
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	289.557339
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	338.636229
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	178.280226
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	113.325312
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	240.201512
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	162.148091
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	420.169726
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	309.042117
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	230.188450
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	105.382322
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	157.985034
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	149.080361
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	129.331609
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	144.705176
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	138.019089
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	336.463304
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	284.101008
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	113.607963
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	208.070344
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	246.438533
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	140.413465
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	188.800815
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	181.240365
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	377.767441
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	112.859389
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	1202.418744
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	408.405233
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	149.641808
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	122.631817
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	203.088482
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	134.185938
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	122.115929
SOS those were your words EOS	957.569154
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	144.683661
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	197.225106
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	184.616290
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	264.036522
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	146.612137
SOS the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me EOS	181.348643
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318

SOS did you on reading it give any credit to its contents EOS	261.389433
SOS she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed EOS	200.118171
SOS i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary EOS	239.238365
SOS i hope you have destroyed the letter EOS	291.333453
SOS there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again EOS	172.476538
SOS i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me EOS	122.675884
SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	128.472174
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	129.099660
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	236.712467
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	307.394012
SOS but think no more of the letter EOS	538.632272
SOS the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten EOS	142.988298
SOS you must learn some of my philosophy EOS	402.476037
SOS think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure EOS	220.985851
SOS i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind EOS	263.165116
SOS your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance EOS	136.595649

SOS as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper EOS	217.992004
SOS i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit EOS	215.876775
SOS unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own EOS	85.451831

SOS no indeed i felt nothing but surprise EOS	460.505780
SOS your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you EOS	174.746525
SOS my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due EOS	140.325665
SOS my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to EOS	129.541975
SOS how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you EOS	134.326528
SOS he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend EOS	125.061381
SOS she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther EOS	235.051416
SOS after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home EOS	117.979764
SOS what could become of TITLE bingley and jane EOS	295.487734
SOS was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs EOS	336.233146

SOS on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago EOS	177.543696
SOS i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent EOS	174.382228
SOS his surprise was great EOS	934.669852
SOS he had never had the slightest suspicion EOS	365.679164
SOS i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together EOS	148.508599
SOS elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend EOS	115.252376
SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	182.437662
SOS from the former EOS	1446.624028
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	199.256199
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	204.352136
SOS it did EOS	4291.080283
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	315.139085
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	130.285562
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	188.685273
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	144.110362
SOS he was angry EOS	1438.814176
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	160.463840
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	155.384969
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	116.771114
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	178.988436

SOS in the hall they parted EOS	522.339837
SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	144.352507

SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	197.411809
SOS she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth EOS	167.040810
SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	131.282413
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	164.835402
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	128.790686
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	186.293881
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	346.371588

SOS that is all to be forgot EOS	802.771473

SOS very very much EOS	1230.985214
SOS nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight EOS	304.705891

SOS and do you really love him quite well enough EOS	286.510652
SOS oh lizzy EOS	1484.459091

SOS it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began EOS	243.148840
SOS but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley EOS	148.493788
SOS another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment EOS	124.472896
SOS when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish EOS	227.894844
SOS now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself EOS	254.978291
SOS i always had a value for him EOS	424.143926
SOS were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me EOS	235.218036
SOS but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me EOS	154.837671
SOS how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton EOS	296.684581
SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	443.448771
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	585.465517
SOS she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend EOS	129.229391
SOS but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage EOS	232.400922
SOS all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation EOS	329.002059

SOS what shall we do with him EOS	508.991050
SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	264.383535
SOS elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet EOS	118.670558
SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	100.853340
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	142.582368
SOS it is a nice long walk and TITLE darcy has never seen the view EOS	180.528578

SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	127.571490
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	139.182621
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	151.341841
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	139.287590
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	125.693162

SOS are you out of your senses to be accepting this man EOS	290.339726
SOS have not you always hated him EOS	499.827284
SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	169.043156
SOS it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to TITLE darcy EOS	151.213417
SOS or in other words you are determined to have him EOS	308.270681
SOS he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane EOS	153.099462

SOS but let me advise you to think better of it EOS	213.566243
SOS i know your disposition lizzy EOS	458.401690
SOS i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior EOS	144.655753
SOS your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage EOS	156.893955

SOS my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life EOS	183.098193
SOS you know not what you are about EOS	466.777066
SOS elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that TITLE darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match EOS	102.664802
SOS well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say EOS	179.434082
SOS if this be the case he deserves you EOS	324.395900

SOS i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter EOS	149.891374
SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	136.503133
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	102.790206
SOS every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time EOS	107.635616
SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	179.424057
SOS its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it TITLE bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable EOS	159.041022
SOS nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them EOS	162.319603

SOS too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject EOS	132.041907
SOS this will never do EOS	938.175221
SOS you need not distress yourself EOS	321.537709
SOS the moral will be perfectly fair EOS	425.375024
SOS lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts EOS	107.350950
SOS i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude EOS	144.256666
SOS i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s EOS	261.031901
SOS my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing EOS	208.035519
SOS lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use EOS	162.122906
SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	263.984473
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	427.640191
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	371.913533
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	239.680526
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	192.377530
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	180.486143
SOS i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth EOS	198.644882
SOS but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly EOS	155.376851
SOS and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did EOS	159.643953
SOS but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected EOS	283.219065
SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	115.233592
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	464.958522
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	97.641510
SOS you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last EOS	186.575146
SOS i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes EOS	251.347706
SOS how could i be so silly as to wish it EOS	352.755969

SOS we will go round the park every day EOS	197.362816
SOS i am the happiest creature in the world EOS	144.957196
SOS perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice EOS	342.559481
SOS i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh EOS	187.780885
SOS TITLE darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me EOS	198.412565
SOS you are all to come to pemberley at christmas EOS	349.967059
SOS your s c EOS	792.914898
SOS TITLE darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what TITLE bennet sent to TITLE collins in reply to his last EOS	153.178847
SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	301.592924
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	289.318571
SOS console lady catherine as well as you can EOS	232.864126
SOS but if i were you i would stand by the nephew EOS	419.224801
SOS he has more to give EOS	697.868001
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	512.933631
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	205.585101
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	167.203743
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	166.828439
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	138.740935
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	117.710835
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	159.716872
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	243.874436
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	108.930198
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	115.214494
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	214.169250
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	98.993296
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	250.045316
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	118.235646
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	112.828954
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	244.980858
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	144.839133
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	175.082360
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	174.254935
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	103.965320
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	95.466208
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	275.542122
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	227.682166
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	151.493576
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	95.006294
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	169.597871
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	212.487503
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	110.386940
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	147.738055
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	115.409532
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	119.245303
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	157.151482
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	125.663668
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	217.953474
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	229.051922
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	187.636573
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	171.278362
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	112.862630
SOS any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to TITLE darcy about it if you had rather not EOS	170.172472
SOS yours c EOS	1015.002916
SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	208.390862
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	123.463215
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	105.746647
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	176.677371
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	122.022129
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	128.412976
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	201.903841
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	131.482526
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	107.503945
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	254.491191
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	204.835293
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	121.012865
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	171.171111
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	201.932895
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	132.396227
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	116.282409
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	113.221486
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	247.021851
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	123.019817
