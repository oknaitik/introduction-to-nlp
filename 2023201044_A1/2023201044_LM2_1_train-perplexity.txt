SOS this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make EOS	10513.418678

SOS the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification EOS	3949.165435
SOS TITLE collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give EOS	9174.026281

SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	12370.990763
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	9823.466203
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	8669.797111
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	7314.988441
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	7304.424145
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	6578.053676
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	11576.448989
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	14140.852702
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	13434.871747
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	16456.298229
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	9173.696304

SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	13397.155758
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	11480.347950
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	19400.386397

SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	15021.967629
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	15107.761865
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	13699.183455

SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	13613.933674
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	19176.504337
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	12529.980986
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	16906.137388
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	12723.454231
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	9819.230504
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	14414.948808

SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	12268.234782
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	14107.152211
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	10533.047278

SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	7951.592170
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	9065.825349
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	8274.965688

SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	9886.818311
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	11587.212024
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	14397.723743

SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	12163.005205
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	9526.624941

SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	20540.791212
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	10244.056787
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	5296.770795
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	15070.175873

SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	4291.881595
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	5191.510064
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	23039.420493
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	12735.311561
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	11630.501067
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	15559.166995
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	26168.890158

SOS accompanied by a violent yawn EOS	17082.103158
SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	10807.319379
SOS bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time EOS	7667.322130
SOS TITLE bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months EOS	5811.231935
SOS of having another daughter married to TITLE collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure EOS	3779.722212

SOS you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken EOS	10934.793175

SOS but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did EOS	9390.410384
SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	7890.868719
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	8256.194845
SOS twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too EOS	21710.966949

SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	12312.815830
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	6480.703013
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	6869.931312
SOS this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem EOS	15677.527521

SOS i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them EOS	12009.526263
SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	7582.972661
SOS i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long EOS	10371.491459
SOS upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration EOS	5700.717174

SOS nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation EOS	8003.401929
SOS were it certain that lady catherine would think so said TITLE collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you EOS	26453.250161
SOS and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications EOS	12191.459139
SOS indeed TITLE collins all praise of me will be unnecessary EOS	21437.897240
SOS you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say EOS	17144.006979
SOS i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise EOS	7439.464853

SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	8799.302084
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	12410.026505
SOS if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one EOS	27420.429702
SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	10260.535249
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	9291.842528
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	8947.749501
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	18044.818333
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	16211.180285
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	8787.493550

SOS cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable EOS	7014.415089
SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	10676.166661
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	8392.330133
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	8864.519404
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	10738.510943
SOS but depend upon it TITLE collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason EOS	8876.775099
SOS i will speak to her about it myself directly EOS	7907.619951
SOS she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it EOS	25057.050436
SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	9731.770843
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	13692.485407
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	12570.040774
SOS lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these EOS	11325.297262

SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	13073.695957

SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	12036.627447

SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	17308.910447
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	11261.534854
SOS a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love EOS	10423.820220
SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	10189.922992

SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	10435.578348
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	17762.986810

SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	9366.903204

SOS his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam EOS	8627.020008

SOS i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice EOS	11677.004962

SOS elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me TITLE darcy by coming in all this state to hear me EOS	13722.595681
SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	16242.437121

SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	13430.198879
SOS i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own EOS	10186.175095
SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	12428.675355
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	5103.490467
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	18637.299691
SOS i am not afraid of you said he smilingly EOS	16930.691945
SOS pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam EOS	6172.378937

SOS you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful EOS	5382.624814
SOS the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did EOS	9630.485360
SOS he danced only four dances EOS	12262.434781
SOS i am sorry to pain you but so it was EOS	15093.155803

SOS TITLE darcy you cannot deny the fact EOS	28342.139910
SOS i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party EOS	7425.214409

SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	15108.161114
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	4987.083815
SOS shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers EOS	9853.902201
SOS i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him EOS	15760.119225

SOS it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution EOS	7059.878178

SOS lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master EOS	13766.012987
SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	11911.429466
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	14245.763108
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	9106.152412
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	10161.118651
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	9426.529984
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	10680.081190
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	8464.845626
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	15172.303924
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	4860.088850
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	10872.536206
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	31251.201161
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	11948.470588
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	15326.278056
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	10471.709445
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	17929.723217
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	8432.191202
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	8089.177438
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	14684.645268
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	19544.576521
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	8616.338468
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	5366.107819
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	9524.697328
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	4600.981170
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	8113.889235
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	18544.697428
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	9604.522795
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	6269.427649
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	6759.005749
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	17461.313150
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	5703.017533
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	12523.263809
SOS and what is fifty miles of good road EOS	9461.360788
SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	11342.353559
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	8558.391112
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	19022.137543
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	32350.222089
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	20446.655871
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	4214.553528
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	14898.530514
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	8213.792403
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	9504.409374
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	19594.984123
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	8438.319589
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	13753.707504
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	16898.015106
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	6817.718184
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	8149.985497
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	8501.923522
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	10967.136150
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	5584.787659
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	44027.251146
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	20358.275015
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	31673.930424
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	8176.884492
SOS all field sports were over EOS	16374.438759
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	9642.823591
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	3691.520712
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	8288.773343
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	11296.332855
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	8047.136235
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	4647.012433
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	41792.175394
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	8945.684376
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	11423.663727
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	6997.510414
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	8356.083268
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	11821.437704
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	6817.557087
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	10821.340664
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	9041.397184
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	10412.713968
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	10572.443202
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	4932.774478
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	4858.560033
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	9622.974891
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	13248.484811
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	12849.307311
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	9509.227255
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	7937.306050
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	8920.269566
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	8583.183208

SOS are you going much farther EOS	13522.453915
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	21945.634017
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	4306.269348
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	2762.827228
SOS said she EOS	72977.363137

SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	14568.175875

SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	10007.630014
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	14472.375658
SOS but so we all do EOS	24042.831609
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	6452.238803
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	14038.557663
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	13196.027822

SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	11115.938921
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	9586.559874
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	12083.700203
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	3712.117742
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	5209.715894
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	9854.220566
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	18953.749024
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	10245.701857
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	5349.342562
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	10891.888300
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	8973.220617
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	8695.938728
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	14562.166635
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	20321.957774

SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	12801.414128
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	15776.296735
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	7170.321322
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	9055.071420

SOS it was all conjecture EOS	38572.020062
SOS what is it you mean EOS	34360.961606

SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	18046.285538
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	8639.243505

SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	10317.850238
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	10702.492827

SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	8763.519847
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	18081.197872

SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	19458.363715
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	13455.579590

SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	11393.630478

SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	9349.704607

SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	13985.090527
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	18193.719748
SOS she went on EOS	20257.571634
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	12336.843946

SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	19762.460113

SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	12021.646775
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	15094.219033
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	13692.082869
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	8132.863141
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	8815.871861
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	9522.545214

SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	9170.406939

SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	8958.102436
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	9283.437633

SOS i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read EOS	12188.953443
SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	19590.583535
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	6919.846772
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	16340.207481
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	7707.191696
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	10091.630595
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	17002.996273
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	14848.355616
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	8641.136565
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	9002.657048
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	20228.166602
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	7487.044139
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	12475.874965
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	9227.345933
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	19255.639909
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	5399.211875
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	28216.660020
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	16480.541526
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	29286.206982
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	11867.583148
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	19639.648575
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	8597.167726
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	9602.803642
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	6964.148999
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	5105.974405
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	5805.452250
SOS pardon me EOS	21966.546465
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	33648.092202
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	11450.827965
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	14652.530057
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	7799.046083
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	11878.145802
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	8605.113390
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	8294.524066
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	19765.040482
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	14264.614953
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	11338.565965
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	16457.033138
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	15800.829994
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	7797.476192
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	4721.822518
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	16033.318809
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	7441.706848
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	8126.196266
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	14484.213912
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	10015.910827
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	11020.336427
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	16489.166541
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	24354.984747
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	19785.192695
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	9581.675970
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	10915.839238

SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	10710.482787
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	14288.277304
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	8071.363458
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	14814.733888
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	8053.541468
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	21362.426348

SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	9601.634875
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	8317.079343
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	13544.869832

SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	11845.432983
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	21732.072643

SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	11552.031642
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	6814.636028

SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	9177.909425

SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	10447.798572
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	15585.688046

SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	22216.265368
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	9522.024758
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	9222.202062
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	8394.323184
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	8130.645895
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	16406.764974
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	27815.433779
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	15200.434108
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	5490.164729

SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	7558.978308
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	11374.347951
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	13541.253597
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	8336.059850
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	12794.196218
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	9517.537162
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	8201.577773
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	17053.137235
SOS again she read on EOS	28424.536484
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	14112.756766
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	19489.485194
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	14345.620270

SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	12962.918622
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	32201.013508
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	16106.228226

SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	17451.472309
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	7692.888801

SOS she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before EOS	19126.573054
SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	14612.677086
SOS she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing TITLE darcy that TITLE darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week EOS	9597.089319

SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	8935.395358
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	8636.915067
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	10383.574735
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	13965.756007

SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	15506.230320

SOS after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation EOS	8019.574933

SOS it would be dreadful EOS	34197.020832
SOS she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk EOS	11345.817572
SOS but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered EOS	15842.376159

SOS a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme EOS	6312.112369

SOS in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger EOS	16998.484292
SOS elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her EOS	13006.081756
SOS at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of TITLE darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her EOS	14033.406823
SOS she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery EOS	11023.068722
SOS TITLE reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time EOS	9576.780542
SOS there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance EOS	11143.329633
SOS the commendation bestowed on him by TITLE reynolds was of no trifling nature EOS	18500.404491
SOS what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant EOS	15862.468296
SOS as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship EOS	9037.530203
SOS how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow EOS	17210.742748
SOS how much of good or evil must be done by him EOS	17415.818355
SOS every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression EOS	9832.591569
SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	7922.927214
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	7982.011678
SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	9701.258951
SOS their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush EOS	8961.178559
SOS he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility EOS	6579.401872
SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	8829.434302
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	7379.518295
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	7270.948949
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	9814.654402
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	8855.668058
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	5570.381810
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	9495.105308
SOS she was overpowered by shame and vexation EOS	19769.044442
SOS her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world EOS	15371.150235
SOS how strange must it appear to him EOS	24990.345707
SOS in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man EOS	8472.971318
SOS it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again EOS	13157.588213
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS why did she come EOS	7452.731353
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	12301.083426
SOS had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage EOS	15776.156701
SOS she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting EOS	16508.701468
SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	17286.281396
SOS that he should even speak to her was amazing EOS	19188.745381
SOS but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family EOS	21383.966133
SOS never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting EOS	12692.854428
SOS what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand EOS	8549.986831
SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	19904.326343
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	9396.819911
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	8066.224464
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	21514.272620
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	11025.849481
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	10544.817497
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	6674.816123
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	7285.652867
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	4600.944816
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	10295.201434
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	15464.501998
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	10633.504452
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	11465.683937
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	8634.079190
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	16343.299362
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	5933.626422
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	9943.545425
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	6623.292008
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	9771.865000
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	9533.561938
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	31828.112121
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	11175.536336
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	7867.238726
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	23820.989211
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	9568.073190
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	15743.937055
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	8766.895627
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	31824.982464
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	24271.915144
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	9489.986083
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	6736.535575
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	11043.888291
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	12774.782804
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	10067.943865
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	46956.031863
SOS it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened EOS	25947.303971
SOS my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this EOS	19769.257797

SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	9958.601749
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	12917.726946
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	10136.728495
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	3142.804729
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	9660.165940
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	10883.980621
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	16178.898865
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	14348.771042
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	7776.731878
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	9434.534056
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	21104.037876
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	8253.679661
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	6108.364358

SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	11912.978083

SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	7087.379826

SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	10607.520849
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	9559.959259
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	9273.893215
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	12317.591482

SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	19824.675021
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	10938.490663
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	5658.661867
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	7489.422826

SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	8869.704119
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	6493.950382
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	7807.289187
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	6395.066147

SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	14963.601660
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	15346.377532
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	7703.340971

SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	5674.182639

SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	8149.295696

SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	9198.111838

SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	8695.021288
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	17502.621154
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	10598.532572
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	12144.949642

SOS her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace EOS	15812.506470
SOS she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress EOS	7726.967293

SOS but self though it would intrude could not engross her EOS	17368.627103
SOS lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern EOS	9157.737382

SOS he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away EOS	7213.421082
SOS as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination EOS	13046.519459
SOS if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty EOS	6416.603136
SOS but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment EOS	8949.152450
SOS be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business EOS	13324.582067

SOS but now it was all too natural EOS	18173.422334
SOS for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey EOS	10026.628792
SOS she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body EOS	8899.400583

SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	5148.661761
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	8838.848861
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	7360.891706

SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	14013.949657
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	6702.912897
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	10065.869541
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	9999.085285
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	11830.356743

SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	9737.942008

SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	8711.995782
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990

SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	14181.382167
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	9838.614853
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	5350.678699
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	7535.181846

SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	10153.364597
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	10654.615163
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	2268.482437
SOS they were in street EOS	32777.103914
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	11817.711819
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	11097.894194
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	9144.031467
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	14002.913721
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	10831.645392
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	12868.522094
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	13090.393902
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	9205.409662
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	10748.216812
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	14910.643556
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	13882.071189
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	6836.630640
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	6223.096880
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	17496.865776
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	14649.026008
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	6509.892861
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	9290.224032
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	7165.802806
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	7246.281772
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	14500.348907
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	8439.455991
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	12277.009112
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	15639.779329
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	12281.641022
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	13407.907664
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	15083.302580
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	5200.001004
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	8216.895675
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	6637.846043
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	13913.859760
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	17080.427719
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	9278.791307
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	13709.994433
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	19655.174822
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	9816.872633
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	9897.519974
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	9399.479136
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	11581.228125
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	10543.783084
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	10852.136710
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	10339.230795
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	24871.143091
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	7510.700225
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	18501.010128
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	18822.261788
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	10527.490335
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	18781.743901
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	16549.090970
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	10903.194853
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	5462.016230
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	15306.398458
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	16648.264160
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	11609.204303
SOS a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing EOS	19447.464120

SOS your s very sincerely m EOS	29539.238322
SOS gardiner EOS	7637.995569
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	7964.390189
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	10347.673239
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	9613.491465
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	6512.623315
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	11145.679023
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	9078.526539
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	15191.110254
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	13077.695731
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	16890.805973
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	42140.702148
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	11071.182172
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	9461.586770
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	12491.324475
SOS they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him EOS	29294.850555
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him EOS	5385.893048
SOS for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him EOS	21685.978239
SOS proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself EOS	11592.960740
SOS she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again EOS	14644.436041
SOS it was hardly enough but it pleased her EOS	11902.199292
SOS she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	6371.793298
SOS she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham EOS	25442.383544
SOS i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister EOS	11980.659593
SOS said he as he joined her EOS	37753.364967

SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	12932.879495
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	6716.756300
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	2708.681610
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	12318.670148
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	13497.682031
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	12324.471466
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	7435.258650
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	9212.491896
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	41332.173760
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	8751.718184
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	8575.508121
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	11972.829030
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	5329.487677
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	7411.341099
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	33487.186214
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	10882.405145
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	24232.859563
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	23228.676894
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	6350.002799
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	9180.977518
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	10176.325198
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	11641.273135
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	23154.130426
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	20144.944850
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	7955.419566
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	6898.711128
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	9819.426443
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	23503.900459

SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	9059.083790

SOS thank heaven EOS	6599.039966
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	8768.393378
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	20475.492038
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	6230.229601
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	6458.093974
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	26416.910646

SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	9945.331075
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	10799.663831
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	13933.654317
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	20106.800124
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	13930.072072
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	8367.486534
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	10087.476823

SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	7156.093184
SOS they then went away EOS	2423.714054
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	7128.769186
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	10336.664878

SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	11173.130316
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	2970.180001

SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	8466.775973
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	13919.498798
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	10813.175034
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	8136.561399

SOS if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever EOS	17350.293632
SOS the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas EOS	10836.125604
SOS the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair EOS	10108.977878

SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	11785.280779

SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	21258.861907
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	17242.186163
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	17044.892650

SOS i came to try you EOS	14676.280383
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	8235.398563

SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	17510.977892

SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	6228.762565
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	3747.184907
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	11417.233903
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	11020.204991
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	11883.474875

SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	9622.398368
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	10782.442239
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	11215.913935
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	9721.535968
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	7521.798620
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	15199.240684
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	10041.731958
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	10650.518831
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	6026.017108
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	9950.974319
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	15182.173488
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	11973.702603
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	11547.526636
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	11534.647796
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	23326.322813
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	12616.196221
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	10973.142477
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	10423.899651
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	20613.000839
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	16341.300700
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	5866.658408
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	22498.292056
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	16995.504775
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	15768.549574
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	5092.298443
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	8654.586249
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	11946.436688
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	15309.229344
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	14811.836061
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	9018.665952
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	12141.846352
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	31028.520810
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	72977.363137
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	72977.363137
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	13662.827236
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	11242.719053
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	19767.528345
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	17788.323741
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	6643.273950
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	16613.404916
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	15496.898473
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	14991.668387
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	9726.825030
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	6696.496231
SOS but now it comes out EOS	4720.792584
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	22533.913655
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	5380.058259
SOS mr EOS	37503.484401
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	30601.189440
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	10250.895887
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	7418.372415
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	15975.999955
SOS it is admirable EOS	39363.406693
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	13914.296976
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	19642.816143
SOS are you not diverted EOS	43629.000006
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS yes EOS	9049.942102
SOS pray read on EOS	8279.337624
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	11488.921312
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	16795.149424
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	6143.408278
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	15733.562242
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	27412.147960
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	14106.280049
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	25318.206290
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	12485.904711
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	11238.726760
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	16013.214606

SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	5106.237616
SOS but it is so strange EOS	40271.229798
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	18677.609118
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	8051.616722
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	14610.380856
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	10777.871864
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	5718.132181
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	6471.595897
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	14994.067249
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	42158.446457
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	13319.988848
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	11121.165420
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	5648.798874
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	7951.741615
SOS it was agreed to EOS	36472.260386
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	7352.447411
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	15568.361467
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	9497.875101
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	9925.955751
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	5808.960859
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	14263.088594
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	14118.093982
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	13486.129833
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	19540.507473
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	7103.823556
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	11826.577647
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	17382.144247
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	11655.762138
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	14987.827891
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	10342.745110
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	8775.905575
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	18029.451288
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	19252.132554
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	30178.977666

SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	14476.781605
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	13308.705352
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	6993.594411
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	13083.588245
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	9345.889192
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	15609.870665
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	9521.612289
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	10921.489048
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	14532.005221
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	7870.998880
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	10734.475783
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	10597.585305
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	26173.303440
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	16605.958701
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	8698.091124
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	36884.464444
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	47706.509823
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	16860.405221
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	7066.778207
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	16813.848507
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	11762.606761

SOS i can easily believe it EOS	13361.616112

SOS i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me EOS	13613.442523
SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	9799.210693
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	5567.357302
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	5802.838131

SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	15359.759639
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	12316.588616

SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	6887.044986

SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	7857.832124

SOS i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s EOS	17758.330372

SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	9623.047179
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	15379.656937
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	6960.117976
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	13796.582842
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	21387.280023
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	17474.689394

SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	8111.308046
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	11615.785898
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	9182.152232

SOS your s sincerely c EOS	16607.064026
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	11421.853543
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	8746.862884
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	12497.181793
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	10129.118959
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	10029.757961
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	8319.195741
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	13510.656872
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	5175.001924
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	11339.786478

SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	7123.015178
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	9930.269133
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	11920.314560
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	9323.577258
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	17749.542631
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	16928.097546
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	9905.700539
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	5650.727634
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	6362.303170
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	20773.934596
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	9074.105426
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	6845.371457
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	7190.729334
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	9955.134076
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	10479.551874
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	11523.946864
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	8786.761309
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	11523.997305
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	22399.828773
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	12601.319287
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	15718.620967

SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	10939.044020
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	6942.674614

SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	10817.484597
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	9204.372358
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	15344.857423
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	8107.682670
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	12384.368790
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	10386.582702
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	9551.074452
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	10750.845014
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	8824.691438
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	9202.952100
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	7228.281401
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	4831.171338
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	17713.621340
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	10663.473999
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	13021.840538
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	12597.793802
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	15662.428198
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	11752.772835
