SOS TITLE wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry EOS	2.288608
SOS it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire EOS	3.342763

SOS this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make EOS	1.605444

SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	2.242522
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	1.869097
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	33.906284
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	3.245193
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	3.277471
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	5.844177
SOS very well EOS	611.791289
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	18.295406
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	3.520671
SOS but now we may be silent EOS	32.125039
SOS do you talk by rule then while you are dancing EOS	7.378897
SOS sometimes EOS	13207.388604
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	14.249862
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	2.544448
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	3.385791
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	3.349011
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	2.049310
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	6.102371
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	7.140447
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	22.907467
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	15.861824
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	2.818784
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	2.851052
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	123.083297
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	2.743826
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	2.058723
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	3.206458
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	7.650684
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	2.111290
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	11.065259
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	10.695117
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	9.477895
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	1.905912
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	26.035261
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	9.930090
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	2.962141
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	2.039253
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	2.528191
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	15.348671
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	3.569181
SOS we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine EOS	3.467808
SOS what think you of books EOS	44.821762
SOS said he smiling EOS	231.601375
SOS books oh EOS	639.524640
SOS no EOS	8206.242372
SOS i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings EOS	6.213499
SOS i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject EOS	3.785144
SOS we may compare our different opinions EOS	25.526472
SOS no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else EOS	3.598643
SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	8.914367
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	22.639073
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	1.793001
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	7.613282
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	17.920828
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	10.668159
SOS i hope not EOS	422.236914
SOS it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first EOS	3.327698
SOS may i ask to what these questions tend EOS	10.182347
SOS merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity EOS	3.358136
SOS i am trying to make it out EOS	27.040238
SOS and what is your success EOS	73.102726
SOS she shook her head EOS	129.454553
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	24.495917
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	8.420624
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	2.147888
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	5.769462
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	7.319517
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	1.947925
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	2.387192
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	2.432379
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	1.933677
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	2.302884
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	3.041846
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	2.780771
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	2.368047
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	7.669427
SOS excuse my interference EOS	140.739426
SOS it was kindly meant EOS	122.624018

SOS said elizabeth to herself EOS	77.945834
SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	3.870033
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	4.608271
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	3.868117
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	2.758849
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	2.638031
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	3.533486
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	3.734786
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	5.593789
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	2.046947
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	6.173303
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	16.723397
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	6.542142
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	7.870033
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	133.480363
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	14.858998
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	3.011235
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	3.581532
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	2.237212
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	3.353260
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	2.922285
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	2.062391
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	3.368934
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	2.904143
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	18.965286
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	4.061255
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	2.424212
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	8.319141
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	9.888546
SOS indeed i am EOS	210.454530
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	9.227796
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	22.741893
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	5.496977
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	2.081491
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	1.564019
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	2.522584
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	1.650895
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	2.377647
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	2.130215
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	8.561810
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	3.057261
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	2.357129
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	30.170634
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	7.406726
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	17.267267
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	2.879912
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	26.194928
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	10.748213
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	2.138218
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	2.044926
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	2.587748
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	1.937143
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	4.137054
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	2.018579
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	1.871861
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	2.327705
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	2.887754
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	2.103243
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	12.829457
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	6.977434
SOS i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear EOS	3.680060
SOS for heaven s sake madam speak lower EOS	14.841466
SOS what advantage can it be to you to offend TITLE darcy EOS	7.961161
SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	8.545243
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	10.866523
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	7.082713
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	10.899888
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	2.521590
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	4.393609
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	2.313615
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	53.584198
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	2.294826
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	2.040763
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	1.687505
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	3.542841
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	118.807562
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	4.059119
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	3.066904
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	5.134300
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	3.299704
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	29.394957
SOS let the other young ladies have time to exhibit EOS	9.583927
SOS mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good EOS	2.481923
SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	11.638887
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	2.425963
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	2.331748
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	11.890357
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	2.895780
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	2.127967
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	3.484597
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	2.614914
SOS and with a bow to TITLE darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room EOS	3.585676
SOS many stared EOS	922.354138
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	2.021216
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	1.834417
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	2.480511
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	17.455909
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	2.695797
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	2.641076
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	2.495087
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	14.132648
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	3.292771
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	2.789078
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	6.066564
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	2.114409
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	3.365171
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	1.970461
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	35.763798
SOS TITLE bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene EOS	11.635814

SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	1.976821
SOS bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time EOS	2.157352
SOS TITLE bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months EOS	2.040623
SOS of having another daughter married to TITLE collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure EOS	3.566035
SOS elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by TITLE bingley and netherfield EOS	2.544277

SOS and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing TITLE collins EOS	2.403111
SOS elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion EOS	1.986202
SOS TITLE bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone TITLE collins began EOS	6.631056
SOS believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections EOS	3.037506
SOS you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address EOS	2.856059
SOS you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken EOS	2.482282
SOS almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life EOS	3.828291
SOS but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did EOS	2.323550
SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	1.753416
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	2.254294
SOS twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too EOS	6.092082
SOS on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while TITLE jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said TITLE collins you must marry EOS	2.336945
SOS a clergyman like you must marry EOS	24.455227
SOS chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way EOS	1.874677
SOS this is my advice EOS	93.279696
SOS find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her EOS	4.108520
SOS allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer EOS	2.754778
SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	2.048399
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	1.953609
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	1.736997
SOS this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem EOS	3.981736
SOS and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection EOS	3.579201
SOS to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents EOS	2.258552
SOS which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to EOS	3.276767
SOS on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married EOS	2.614379
SOS it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now EOS	14.465044
SOS you are too hasty sir she cried EOS	22.906961
SOS you forget that i have made no answer EOS	17.907068
SOS let me do it without farther loss of time EOS	9.583927
SOS accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me EOS	6.202877
SOS i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them EOS	4.479392
SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	1.747246
SOS i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long EOS	3.600251
SOS upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration EOS	3.366319
SOS i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time EOS	2.469350
SOS i am perfectly serious in my refusal EOS	23.227637
SOS you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so EOS	4.904549
SOS nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation EOS	2.891773
SOS were it certain that lady catherine would think so said TITLE collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you EOS	2.642838
SOS and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications EOS	3.253781
SOS indeed TITLE collins all praise of me will be unnecessary EOS	6.994953
SOS you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say EOS	4.110218
SOS i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise EOS	3.653384
SOS in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach EOS	2.314066
SOS this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled EOS	9.658141
SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	1.579682
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	4.832762
SOS if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one EOS	2.771979
SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	3.092649
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	2.294192
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	1.998559
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	3.157058
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	2.009227
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	3.499811
SOS i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere EOS	9.088387
SOS i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible EOS	3.612170
SOS my feelings in every respect forbid it EOS	23.031854
SOS can i speak plainer EOS	70.161205
SOS do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart EOS	2.477162
SOS you are uniformly charming EOS	113.653279
SOS cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable EOS	2.336055
SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	1.588805
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	1.745902
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	1.683315
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	2.377466
SOS but depend upon it TITLE collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason EOS	5.788104
SOS i will speak to her about it myself directly EOS	13.820014
SOS she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it EOS	3.788688
SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	1.827063
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	2.096452
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	9.938621
SOS lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these EOS	8.653294
SOS in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived EOS	5.686298
SOS i will go directly to TITLE bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure EOS	5.121047
SOS she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh EOS	4.066184
SOS TITLE bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar EOS	7.186864
SOS you must come and make lizzy marry TITLE collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her EOS	2.891452
SOS TITLE bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication EOS	2.779339
SOS i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech EOS	7.566962
SOS of what are you talking EOS	38.837654
SOS of TITLE collins and lizzy EOS	78.793168
SOS lizzy declares she will not have TITLE collins and TITLE collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy EOS	5.677877
SOS and what am i to do on the occasion EOS	11.906769
SOS it seems an hopeless business EOS	55.014810
SOS speak to lizzy about it yourself EOS	15.940806
SOS tell her that you insist upon her marrying him EOS	7.612919
SOS let her be called down EOS	43.242009

SOS i have sent for you on an affair of importance EOS	9.596373
SOS i understand that TITLE collins has made you an offer of marriage EOS	9.126259
SOS is it true EOS	220.269106
SOS elizabeth replied that it was EOS	53.584198

SOS your mother will never see you again if you do not marry TITLE collins and i will never see you again if you do EOS	3.928900
SOS elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but TITLE bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed EOS	2.822822
SOS what do you mean TITLE bennet by talking in this way EOS	7.173402
SOS you promised me to insist upon her marrying him EOS	11.425792
SOS my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request EOS	6.005206
SOS first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room EOS	2.536864
SOS i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be EOS	8.186074
SOS not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did TITLE bennet give up the point EOS	4.730037
SOS she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns EOS	7.488114
SOS she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks EOS	2.184845
SOS though her manner varied however her determination never did EOS	8.438534
SOS TITLE collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed EOS	7.546841
SOS he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way EOS	2.373833
SOS his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret EOS	3.538236
SOS while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them EOS	4.192594
SOS she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here EOS	2.894706
SOS what do you think has happened this morning EOS	15.510493
SOS TITLE collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him EOS	6.775050
SOS charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where TITLE bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family EOS	1.891211
SOS pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves EOS	2.259397
SOS charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth EOS	6.691145
SOS aye there she comes continued TITLE bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way EOS	2.055391
SOS but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead EOS	2.383311
SOS i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you EOS	10.620337
SOS i have done with you from this very day EOS	12.894756
SOS i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word EOS	4.175305
SOS i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children EOS	17.213589

SOS nobody can tell what i suffer EOS	16.891420
SOS but it is always so EOS	65.949523
SOS those who do not complain are never pitied EOS	9.734177
SOS her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation EOS	2.805399
SOS she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by TITLE collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let TITLE collins and me have a little conversation together EOS	1.872513
SOS elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of TITLE collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear EOS	1.884420
SOS in a doleful voice TITLE bennet thus began the projected conversation EOS	6.738316
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS TITLE collins EOS	868.042025
SOS my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point EOS	5.227047
SOS far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter EOS	2.748266
SOS resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned EOS	2.754986
SOS perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation EOS	1.745010
SOS you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and TITLE bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf EOS	2.133156
SOS my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own EOS	2.976589

SOS i have certainly meant well through the whole affair EOS	12.894756
SOS my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise EOS	2.080673
SOS the discussion of TITLE collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother EOS	2.605904
SOS as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence EOS	2.251767
SOS he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend EOS	2.437404
SOS the morrow produced no abatement of TITLE bennet s ill humour or ill health EOS	6.811462
SOS TITLE collins was also in the same state of angry pride EOS	9.228066
SOS elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it EOS	3.323526
SOS he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay EOS	4.444455
SOS after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if TITLE wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball EOS	2.567311
SOS he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over EOS	2.635284
SOS to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed EOS	4.689912
SOS i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet TITLE darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself EOS	2.257912
SOS she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her EOS	1.914773
SOS his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother EOS	2.646131
SOS soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately EOS	3.045278
SOS the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages EOS	2.150049
SOS jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs EOS	1.695581
SOS when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal EOS	2.430100
SOS the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again EOS	3.272291
SOS you shall hear what she says EOS	29.394957
SOS she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where TITLE hurst had a house EOS	1.903690
SOS the next was in these words EOS	34.355218
SOS i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence EOS	1.765690
SOS i depend on you for that EOS	34.939055
SOS to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent TITLE bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his EOS	1.924458
SOS it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country EOS	4.124920
SOS but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters EOS	1.854586
SOS TITLE bingley will not be detained in london by them EOS	11.243843
SOS caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter EOS	4.782766
SOS i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel EOS	1.713381
SOS many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair EOS	2.435201
SOS i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you EOS	2.028659
SOS it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter EOS	5.155914
SOS it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should EOS	7.589128
SOS why will you think so EOS	41.308694

SOS TITLE darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again EOS	3.295619
SOS i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister EOS	1.917838
SOS i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable EOS	3.010296
SOS my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart EOS	1.853258

SOS said jane as she finished it EOS	26.267511
SOS is it not clear enough EOS	36.472796
SOS does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly EOS	2.109766

SOS but the case is this EOS	57.277528
SOS we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way EOS	1.748396
SOS but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend EOS	2.016692
SOS if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy EOS	3.569716
SOS but i know the foundation is unjust EOS	22.704261
SOS caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself EOS	2.810010

SOS but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere EOS	2.649458
SOS you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him EOS	2.048247
SOS how can you talk so EOS	48.208402
SOS said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate EOS	3.810434

SOS but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required EOS	6.121503
SOS a thousand things may arise in six months EOS	12.018345
SOS the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt EOS	7.851397
SOS it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one EOS	2.392956
SOS she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect EOS	4.064290
SOS jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart EOS	2.090272
SOS they agreed that TITLE bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together EOS	2.041362
SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	1.973529
SOS the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to TITLE collins EOS	3.443510
SOS elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her EOS	24.216450
SOS it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express EOS	4.506681
SOS charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time EOS	2.781460
SOS this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of TITLE collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself EOS	2.153486
SOS such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon EOS	2.568985
SOS but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet EOS	2.117431
SOS he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday EOS	1.693778
SOS his reception however was of the most flattering kind EOS	11.591190
SOS miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane EOS	3.033631
SOS but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there EOS	4.636872
SOS in as short a time as TITLE collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness EOS	1.909054
SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	1.766320
SOS sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity EOS	3.566080
SOS TITLE collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair EOS	2.599302
SOS lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer TITLE bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever TITLE collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st EOS	1.804500
SOS james s EOS	477.745778

SOS she had gained her point and had time to consider of it EOS	7.221833
SOS her reflections were in general satisfactory EOS	26.597400
SOS TITLE collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary EOS	3.586414
SOS but still he would be her husband EOS	22.704261
SOS without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want EOS	1.818217
SOS this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it EOS	2.818154
SOS the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person EOS	2.772063
SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	3.344781
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	2.676840
SOS a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love EOS	1.890954
SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	1.941670
SOS my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible EOS	2.812464
SOS they were all astonished and TITLE bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir EOS	2.800501
SOS you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness EOS	4.843887

SOS believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire EOS	1.931096
SOS as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth EOS	2.509910
SOS with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return EOS	3.455565
SOS TITLE bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him EOS	2.934214
SOS she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion EOS	1.976700
SOS but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away EOS	7.692095
SOS miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before EOS	3.710030
SOS the possibility of TITLE collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to TITLE collins EOS	2.057979
SOS my dear charlotte impossible EOS	121.436148
SOS the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza EOS	1.895538
SOS do you think it incredible that TITLE collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you EOS	3.361481
SOS but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness EOS	2.465842

SOS elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family EOS	5.479081
SOS charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard EOS	3.839523
SOS it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match EOS	4.255742
SOS the strangeness of TITLE collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted EOS	4.266719
SOS she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage EOS	2.696213
SOS charlotte the wife of TITLE collins was a most humiliating picture EOS	11.722187

SOS elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family EOS	2.420328
SOS with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for TITLE bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord EOS	1.680916

SOS do not you know that TITLE collins wants to marry lizzy EOS	8.623921
SOS nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy EOS	1.880699
SOS elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of TITLE collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london EOS	1.511670
SOS TITLE bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent EOS	2.678604

SOS TITLE bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter EOS	2.097560
SOS jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable EOS	2.138802
SOS kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for TITLE collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton EOS	2.329998

SOS between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again EOS	2.431865

SOS as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to EOS	2.053684

SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	3.087270
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	3.332813

SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	2.341848
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	2.404119
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	1.711383
SOS the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement EOS	3.320162

SOS without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment EOS	2.106809
SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	4.422799
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	2.559228
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	2.366679
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	6.114376

SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	1.903635

SOS TITLE collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to TITLE bennet EOS	2.188886
SOS his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy EOS	2.458766

SOS the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual EOS	2.643056
SOS elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible EOS	2.836957
SOS elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was EOS	2.531776
SOS charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen EOS	1.831451

SOS after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer EOS	1.771145

SOS caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time EOS	2.555427
SOS when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer EOS	2.026674
SOS i pity though i cannot help blaming her EOS	18.966290
SOS she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side EOS	3.003424

SOS scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when TITLE jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light EOS	1.880892
SOS a great deal more passed at the other table EOS	12.953636
SOS lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself EOS	3.446278

SOS as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was EOS	2.506289

SOS sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with EOS	1.891634
SOS while sir william was with them TITLE collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road EOS	1.616790
SOS the room in which the ladies sat was backwards EOS	12.743544
SOS elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for TITLE collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement EOS	1.636839
SOS from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to TITLE collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day EOS	1.922995
SOS she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out EOS	4.046511
SOS very few days passed in which TITLE collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours EOS	1.960938
SOS now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits EOS	2.977041
SOS she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that TITLE collins s joints of meat were too large for her family EOS	1.932079
SOS elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by TITLE collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty EOS	1.654412
SOS the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first EOS	2.242178
SOS their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach EOS	3.107836

SOS elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that TITLE darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself EOS	1.780880

SOS TITLE darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to TITLE collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure EOS	2.749997
SOS elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word EOS	12.294256
SOS colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to TITLE collins sat for some time without speaking to any body EOS	1.910926
SOS at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family EOS	3.067878

SOS have you never happened to see her there EOS	12.570940
SOS she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet EOS	2.598744
SOS the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away EOS	6.661349
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings EOS	2.705101
SOS it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening EOS	2.129042

SOS her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room EOS	2.276821
SOS colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and TITLE collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much EOS	2.552056
SOS he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of TITLE darcy EOS	1.871613

SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	7.701881

SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	8.319141

SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	2.184739
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	2.396675
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	1.828338

SOS he danced only four dances EOS	48.418254

SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	8.688230
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	22.453324

SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	4.487579
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	5.507245
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	2.220969
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	3.322912
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	2.890398
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	2.333223
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	2.095405
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	2.733476
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	3.238936
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	2.150920
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	2.941429
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	7.652992
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	25.288824
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	3.141968
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	4.003291
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	3.678692
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	2.498174
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	2.297696
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	4.849851
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	90.048831

SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	7.296102
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	2.467630
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	3.051093

SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	4.318468
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	2.297777
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	5.209507
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	4.135531
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	32.103715

SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	20.815199
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	4.112462
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	1.930748
SOS all field sports were over EOS	34.976658
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	1.596118
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	3.591126
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	1.735715
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	4.451660

SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	15.094098

SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	4.435787
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	5.593839
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	2.603665
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	1.932045
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	5.130821
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	2.167231
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	3.755937
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	2.378050
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	7.534353
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	14.107998
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	2.023030
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	1.808915
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	26.325329
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	10.412339
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	3.492022
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	4.072167
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	2.037010
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	2.901755
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	2.636613
SOS are you going much farther EOS	35.381170
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	15.800147
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	7.478740
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	15.613066
SOS said she EOS	711.270567
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	10.208438
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	38.147319
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	16.209705
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	3.891369
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	3.843253
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	7.033108
SOS but so we all do EOS	68.784677
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	3.175731
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	502.104981
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	4.945223
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	4.920906
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	5.509933
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	2.737526
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	3.788375
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	6.121359
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	11.277075
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	3.917188
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	2.176941
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	14.841466
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	2.861636
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	3.369616
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	9.606175
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	2.184985
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	5.916476
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	3.173668
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	4.928368
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	10.608074
SOS are you indeed EOS	210.454530
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	13.429231
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	12.645587
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	2.324028
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	2.262513
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	20.550085
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	4.904997
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	4.779512
SOS i think i have heard you say that you know them EOS	13.542760
SOS i know them a little EOS	63.172736
SOS their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s EOS	5.095445
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	3.723396
SOS care of him EOS	127.172428
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	4.279938
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	3.052613
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	5.069795
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	135.804649
SOS what is it you mean EOS	44.821762
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	2.736595
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	14.782423
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	8.323258
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	1.723601
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	6.800479
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	6.991320
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	10.668159
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	7.191409
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	11.618726
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	7.087055
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	5.706398
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	9.491364
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	9.395774
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	21.984137
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	10.660829
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	2.528641
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	4.118577
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	9.039548
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	3.774093
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	2.428584
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	4.142336
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	3.847453
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	4.322516
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	3.239186
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	2.678941
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	2.754541
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	1.949434
SOS to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection EOS	6.688199
SOS all loveliness and goodness as she is EOS	14.382479
SOS her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating EOS	8.914081
SOS neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which TITLE darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach EOS	2.049623
SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	1.864384
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	1.846499
SOS TITLE collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but TITLE collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home EOS	2.265369
SOS when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against TITLE darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent EOS	2.389125
SOS they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering EOS	3.204993
SOS but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded EOS	1.993126
SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	3.466862
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	4.650056
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	1.833964
SOS she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him EOS	2.452711
SOS while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her EOS	2.096298
SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	3.016131
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	2.909455
SOS she answered him with cold civility EOS	32.259322
SOS he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room EOS	5.684217
SOS elizabeth was surprised but said not a word EOS	15.736448
SOS after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled EOS	2.786669
SOS it will not do EOS	170.816876
SOS my feelings will not be repressed EOS	41.465858
SOS you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you EOS	6.363432
SOS elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression EOS	41.525894
SOS she stared coloured doubted and was silent EOS	22.787280
SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	3.545646
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	3.226449
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	1.920366
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	2.145860
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	4.724065
SOS he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand EOS	2.486705
SOS as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer EOS	5.199524
SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	6.522084
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	1.700284
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	3.874576
SOS but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly EOS	4.453480
SOS i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one EOS	10.019024
SOS it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration EOS	5.804585
SOS the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation EOS	3.056807
SOS TITLE darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise EOS	2.652376
SOS his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature EOS	3.853070
SOS he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it EOS	3.475566
SOS the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful EOS	18.719328
SOS at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting EOS	3.695916
SOS i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected EOS	4.311567
SOS but it is of small importance EOS	40.023735
SOS i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character EOS	2.037901
SOS was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil EOS	6.265501
SOS but i have other provocations EOS	65.957267
SOS you know i have EOS	113.653279
SOS had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister EOS	2.139030
SOS as she pronounced these words TITLE darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued EOS	2.445755
SOS i have every reason in the world to think ill of you EOS	11.151456
SOS no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there EOS	5.662032
SOS you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind EOS	1.866856
SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	3.120635
SOS he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity EOS	12.132493
SOS can you deny that you have done it EOS	15.792662
SOS she repeated EOS	3312.802528
SOS with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success EOS	2.628744
SOS towards him i have been kinder than towards myself EOS	9.163351
SOS elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her EOS	3.402280
SOS but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded EOS	5.571489
SOS long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided EOS	4.832762
SOS your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from TITLE wickham EOS	3.735195
SOS on this subject what can you have to say EOS	11.575495
SOS in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself EOS	7.138892
SOS or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others EOS	6.741702
SOS you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour EOS	3.429589
SOS who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him EOS	4.079480
SOS his misfortunes EOS	2061.605438
SOS repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed EOS	6.854375
SOS and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy EOS	15.678990
SOS you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty EOS	6.512665
SOS you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him EOS	5.608407
SOS you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert EOS	3.025920
SOS you have done all this EOS	62.012556
SOS and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule EOS	5.214238
SOS and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me EOS	3.878097
SOS this is the estimation in which you hold me EOS	10.653078
SOS i thank you for explaining it so fully EOS	16.592117
SOS my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed EOS	10.282207
SOS but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design EOS	1.924921
SOS these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing EOS	2.075582
SOS but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence EOS	14.858998
SOS nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related EOS	8.438385
SOS they were natural and just EOS	48.538942
SOS could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections EOS	5.340805
SOS to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own EOS	3.761943
SOS elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken TITLE darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	1.660236
SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	2.557622
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	3.986893
SOS she went on EOS	436.663269
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	1.660094
SOS you have said quite enough madam EOS	29.394957
SOS i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been EOS	3.983526
SOS forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness EOS	2.652525
SOS and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house EOS	2.724639
SOS the tumult of her mind was now painfully great EOS	13.657951
SOS she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour EOS	4.199182
SOS her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it EOS	4.881665
SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	10.100838
SOS that he should have been in love with her for so many months EOS	12.333221
SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	2.419193
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	8.611384
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	1.922691
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	2.648758
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	4.402603
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	2.775310
SOS she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of TITLE darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road EOS	2.270251
SOS the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground EOS	3.921867
SOS after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park EOS	2.829431
SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	2.822838
SOS she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being TITLE darcy she was directly retreating EOS	2.340963
SOS but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name EOS	4.243586
SOS she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be TITLE darcy she moved again towards the gate EOS	3.296709
SOS he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you EOS	2.368006
SOS will you do me the honour of reading that letter EOS	8.179211
SOS and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight EOS	3.959670
SOS with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand EOS	1.972697
SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	31.117118
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	6.606213

SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	2.328457
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	3.420550
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	1.961010
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	1.674869
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	2.202513
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	2.355232
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	7.428760
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	3.050168
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	3.775622
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	18.502552
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	2.044260
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	5.124228
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	2.287411
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	41.836398
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	1.902640
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	7.209517
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	7.691465
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	3.326777
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	2.412981
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	2.465102
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	3.145307
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	1.977234
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	2.333726
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	13.790110
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	2.080019
SOS pardon me EOS	558.741982
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	31.034137
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	1.629557
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	2.001887
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	3.499059
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	9.494015
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	1.953551
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	2.925324
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	34.939055
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	2.247290
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	4.266929
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	4.006032
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	5.885135
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	3.483374
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	12.031446
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	2.384799
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	3.952748
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	2.756400
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	10.777420
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	10.430784
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	6.391336
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	2.407056
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	2.503971
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	2.794556
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	2.081814
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	2.367795
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	2.211884
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	3.841033
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	2.171203
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	4.749457
SOS but whatever may be the sentiments which TITLE wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character EOS	2.800166
SOS it adds even another motive EOS	55.014810
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	1.913778
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	10.039010
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	1.805890
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	2.940123
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	3.775771
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	16.796343
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	34.355218
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	2.659853
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	14.382479
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	4.920303
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	2.131331
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	2.290869
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	5.310556
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	2.080304
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	3.499378
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	2.305014
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	9.853736
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	26.153613
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	6.477052
SOS i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being EOS	2.417086
SOS having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy EOS	7.011093
SOS my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself EOS	3.214097
SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	1.414309
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	2.654267
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	2.202222
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	9.156191
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	2.122881
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	2.573398
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	26.142074
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	2.172650
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	2.765391
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	2.845557
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	7.002652
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	4.893579
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	1.921840
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	1.966374
SOS i will only add god bless you EOS	22.407699
SOS fitzwilliam darcy EOS	639.524640
SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	2.574892
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	3.111690
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	9.150285
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	2.206978
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	3.491738
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	2.165743
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	2.353206
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	4.275321
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	33.381854
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	1.697216
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	11.277075
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	7.450629
SOS this cannot be EOS	220.278828
SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	31.642735
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	2.701854
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	1.856016
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	2.571332
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	3.759549
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	2.290780
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	1.951107
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	2.749788
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	21.668941
SOS again she read on EOS	52.327817
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	1.986651
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	2.656831
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	2.399857
SOS of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself EOS	3.532092
SOS as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring EOS	5.216449
SOS his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue EOS	4.171249
SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	1.787222
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	32.125039
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	2.115016
SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	4.813479
SOS but alas EOS	3280.715257
SOS the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question EOS	1.791034
SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	2.203504
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	3.247075
SOS many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory EOS	6.677544
SOS she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before EOS	3.466801
SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	3.933793
SOS she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing TITLE darcy that TITLE darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week EOS	2.788709
SOS she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking TITLE darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son EOS	1.801498
SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	8.121175
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	1.985908
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	2.010124
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	1.671174
SOS that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling EOS	2.129151
SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	2.098637
SOS she grew absolutely ashamed of herself EOS	32.259322
SOS of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd EOS	4.498625
SOS how despicably have i acted EOS	45.059563
SOS she cried EOS	1656.693656
SOS i who have prided myself on my discernment EOS	17.131381
SOS i who have valued myself on my abilities EOS	17.131381
SOS who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust EOS	3.124115

SOS yet how just a humiliation EOS	34.089491
SOS had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind EOS	9.617365
SOS but vanity not love has been my folly EOS	16.787497
SOS pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned EOS	2.024078
SOS till this moment i never knew myself EOS	12.937091
SOS from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that TITLE darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again EOS	2.442814
SOS widely different was the effect of a second perusal EOS	8.309011
SOS how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other EOS	3.746280
SOS he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been EOS	4.293377
SOS neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane EOS	6.398103
SOS she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility EOS	2.977859
SOS when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe EOS	3.310311
SOS the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers EOS	1.981573
SOS the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt EOS	14.668636
SOS it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before EOS	2.049919
SOS after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation EOS	1.622372
SOS she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence TITLE darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found EOS	1.917261

SOS the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and TITLE collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings EOS	1.828545
SOS to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her EOS	2.150681

SOS TITLE collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter EOS	3.278911
SOS lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer EOS	1.916646

SOS lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was EOS	2.137598

SOS TITLE darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart EOS	6.068061
SOS she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different EOS	4.773602
SOS when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion EOS	1.954999

SOS her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil EOS	2.039237
SOS elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement EOS	2.380745

SOS while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever EOS	2.253005
SOS anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and TITLE darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost EOS	2.413971
SOS his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend EOS	2.476040
SOS how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family EOS	2.191595
SOS when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful EOS	2.134917

SOS we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode EOS	4.535192
SOS our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly EOS	1.876716

SOS in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings EOS	2.247932
SOS words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences EOS	2.400441

SOS it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of TITLE darcy s proposals EOS	4.097206
SOS to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther EOS	1.840497
SOS it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where TITLE bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs EOS	1.733067

SOS having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity EOS	1.546989

SOS on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and TITLE darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former EOS	1.926907
SOS he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him EOS	2.523144

SOS wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards TITLE darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right EOS	1.648963
SOS his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by EOS	2.335400
SOS i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe EOS	2.267124
SOS his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart EOS	2.339403
SOS elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head EOS	3.955192

SOS the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again EOS	2.219563

SOS TITLE bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard EOS	1.900960
SOS had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort EOS	2.951108

SOS elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband EOS	5.447529

SOS upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself EOS	2.202114

SOS she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains EOS	2.895767
SOS TITLE gardiner abused her stupidity EOS	53.233111
SOS if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful EOS	3.720585
SOS they have some of the finest woods in the country EOS	10.334466
SOS elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce EOS	11.517139
SOS the possibility of meeting TITLE darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred EOS	6.865309
SOS it would be dreadful EOS	184.158090
SOS she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk EOS	3.381217
SOS but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered EOS	3.052588
SOS accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer EOS	2.006678
SOS a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme EOS	2.059949
SOS to pemberley therefore they were to go EOS	20.881498
SOS elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter EOS	2.582344
SOS the park was very large and contained great variety of ground EOS	7.428760
SOS they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent EOS	3.027892
SOS elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view EOS	3.331696
SOS they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound EOS	1.710958
SOS it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance EOS	1.992717
SOS its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned EOS	9.538966
SOS elizabeth was delighted EOS	392.242914
SOS she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste EOS	2.882306
SOS they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something EOS	3.451315
SOS they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned EOS	2.710958
SOS she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken EOS	16.842380
SOS on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was EOS	2.382226
SOS the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her EOS	3.053288

SOS it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up EOS	9.790706
SOS elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect EOS	5.787785
SOS the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object EOS	3.250855
SOS every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight EOS	2.047931
SOS as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen EOS	2.666801
SOS the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings EOS	1.836911
SOS and of this place thought she i might have been mistress EOS	10.179236
SOS with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted EOS	7.831785
SOS instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt EOS	2.435588

SOS she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it EOS	3.667480
SOS at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while TITLE reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends EOS	2.418868
SOS how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day EOS	3.558462
SOS her aunt now called her to look at a picture EOS	8.914081
SOS she approached and saw the likeness of TITLE wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece EOS	4.011651
SOS her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it EOS	9.940024
SOS the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence EOS	2.812143
SOS he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild EOS	4.894886

SOS and that said TITLE reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him EOS	3.476160

SOS this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then EOS	3.250800
SOS he was very fond of them EOS	46.404143

SOS TITLE gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks TITLE reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister EOS	2.244413
SOS is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year EOS	7.655350
SOS not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months EOS	3.061664

SOS i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other EOS	3.927343
SOS elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old EOS	2.163335
SOS this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas EOS	5.464746
SOS that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion EOS	8.168922
SOS her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said EOS	2.462296
SOS you are lucky in having such a master EOS	14.977152
SOS yes sir i know i am EOS	27.629335

SOS TITLE reynolds could interest her on no other point EOS	10.856982
SOS she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain EOS	3.803238
SOS TITLE gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase EOS	2.006792
SOS he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived EOS	5.319430
SOS not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves EOS	4.657328
SOS there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name EOS	4.394671
SOS some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it EOS	7.022787
SOS to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men EOS	4.751878
SOS in what an amiable light does this place him EOS	10.576866
SOS thought elizabeth EOS	732.072964
SOS this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend EOS	3.215747
SOS perhaps we might be deceived EOS	35.381170
SOS that is not very likely our authority was too good EOS	8.280565
SOS on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley EOS	1.838181
SOS he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows EOS	5.465745
SOS TITLE reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room EOS	6.161646
SOS and this is always the way with him she added EOS	8.925409
SOS whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment EOS	4.424090
SOS there is nothing he would not do for her EOS	12.550141
SOS the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn EOS	4.576249
SOS in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible EOS	1.935589
SOS in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger EOS	3.394551
SOS elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her EOS	4.861300
SOS at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of TITLE darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her EOS	2.540323
SOS she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery EOS	3.400535
SOS TITLE reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time EOS	6.518264
SOS there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance EOS	2.713435
SOS the commendation bestowed on him by TITLE reynolds was of no trifling nature EOS	5.578272
SOS what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant EOS	5.783965
SOS as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship EOS	3.526567
SOS how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow EOS	7.198293
SOS how much of good or evil must be done by him EOS	8.061104
SOS every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression EOS	1.718374
SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	2.001344
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	1.861088
SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	4.097900
SOS their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush EOS	4.135622
SOS he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility EOS	2.243795
SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	3.514620
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	1.805663
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	2.101078
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	1.770073
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	1.704914
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	2.760602
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	2.870459
SOS she was overpowered by shame and vexation EOS	20.896489
SOS her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world EOS	4.499688
SOS how strange must it appear to him EOS	17.391628
SOS in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man EOS	5.549598
SOS it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again EOS	5.706600
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS why did she come EOS	75.693588
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	5.591999
SOS had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage EOS	2.415035
SOS she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting EOS	9.983538
SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	8.602542
SOS that he should even speak to her was amazing EOS	14.053103
SOS but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family EOS	8.653944
SOS never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting EOS	2.346949
SOS what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand EOS	2.779125
SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	9.465982
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	1.765871
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	3.153491
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	3.217361
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	2.777820
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	2.699525
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	2.862648
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	1.748594
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	4.006532
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	6.339294
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	2.264169
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	1.688745
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	2.242877
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	1.586797
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	2.421801
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	3.960708
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	2.541301
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	5.768397
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	2.680492
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	1.737519
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	14.494833
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	2.884536
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	2.122994
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	5.361393
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	14.347581
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	2.151063
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	2.472700
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	13.175608
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	4.497709
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	2.396041
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	1.870351
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	4.068082
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	4.647275
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	4.387092
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	37.713261
SOS it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened EOS	5.012029
SOS my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this EOS	6.334002
SOS it is impossible that he should still love me EOS	15.212002
SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	2.017470
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	2.718735
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	7.094623
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	14.820198
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	1.981408
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	3.094717
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	2.685376
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	23.900663
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	2.564030
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	1.862503
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	3.462054
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	2.229957
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	7.105086
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	6.577431
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	5.747316
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	3.737108
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	3.229974
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	6.223262
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	6.751594
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	4.248689
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	2.505814
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	2.968923
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	3.148736
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	3.728789
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	7.371978
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	3.461854
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	3.360575
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	11.000482
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	5.350942
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	19.074196
SOS to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good EOS	2.593867
SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	9.104038
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	3.349003

SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	2.343502
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	7.369904
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	2.178602
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	25.038953
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	5.518661
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	3.911191
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	4.227714
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	27.041431
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	4.087135
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	2.020980
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	2.783300
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	2.233755
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	2.036044
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	2.219926
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	2.665697
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	3.992348
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	1.915714
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	2.278934
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	2.284237
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	2.300747
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	2.996363
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	1.811098
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	2.478761
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	6.293752
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	3.799122
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	2.970474
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	5.058702
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	2.349213
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	3.132786
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	2.797789
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	2.229592
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	1.905758
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	3.274449
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	5.578753
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	20.053348
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	10.030722
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	2.149143
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	2.766811
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	16.579108
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	1.970368
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	5.129055
SOS in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh EOS	8.595362
SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	4.150886
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	2.040151
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	3.957304
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	9.474797
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	5.063566
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	1.971551
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	2.388641
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	3.807171
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	2.456130
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	3.499185
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	1.707820
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	1.686090
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	1.433125
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	2.370378
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	3.694558
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	2.545978
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	1.627451
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	2.779501
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	2.036973
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	2.329146
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	5.895602
SOS it was evident that she was much better acquainted with TITLE darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her EOS	3.842134
SOS they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry EOS	9.427671
SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	3.457972
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	2.054178
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	2.003232
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	3.229126
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	2.092977
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	4.755177
SOS with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which TITLE darcy afterwards discharged EOS	1.943311
SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	1.873787
SOS she certainly did not hate him EOS	32.259322
SOS no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called EOS	2.728546
SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	1.768920
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	4.047992
SOS it was gratitude EOS	408.055680
SOS gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection EOS	1.805754
SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	1.692984
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	1.979854
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	1.768074
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	1.985581
SOS they were therefore to go EOS	48.538942
SOS elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply EOS	3.724905
SOS TITLE gardiner left them soon after breakfast EOS	19.707720
SOS the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon EOS	3.189995
SOS convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed EOS	1.917727
SOS on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer EOS	3.158194
SOS its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn EOS	2.067416
SOS in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with TITLE hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london EOS	2.875823
SOS georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved EOS	1.761709
SOS TITLE gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her EOS	6.512576
SOS by TITLE hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments EOS	2.301331
SOS it was first broken by TITLE annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and TITLE gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on EOS	1.980125
SOS miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard EOS	2.734402
SOS elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention EOS	3.968012
SOS this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much EOS	2.473311
SOS her own thoughts were employing her EOS	26.597400
SOS she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room EOS	7.567613
SOS she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine EOS	2.669638
SOS after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family EOS	2.272463
SOS she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more EOS	6.454795
SOS the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from TITLE annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post EOS	1.879183
SOS there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table EOS	2.196438
SOS while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of TITLE darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came EOS	1.882342
SOS he had been some time with TITLE gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning EOS	2.360550
SOS no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room EOS	1.731454
SOS in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to TITLE darcy were by no means over EOS	2.219674
SOS miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side EOS	2.527255
SOS miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton EOS	2.308030
SOS they must be a great loss to your family EOS	12.286579
SOS in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone EOS	1.879046
SOS while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes EOS	2.330035
SOS had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps EOS	1.684423
SOS not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement EOS	5.972367
SOS to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own EOS	1.809812
SOS he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend EOS	2.080608
SOS elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more EOS	2.196186
SOS her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully EOS	2.120757
SOS their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while TITLE darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress EOS	2.173160
SOS but georgiana would not join her EOS	32.125039
SOS her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable EOS	2.221593

SOS persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected EOS	1.952497
SOS he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty EOS	1.899176

SOS as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination EOS	1.735881
SOS if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty EOS	3.085159
SOS but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment EOS	1.521357
SOS be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business EOS	2.145815

SOS while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible EOS	1.945414
SOS but now it was all too natural EOS	25.457815
SOS for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey EOS	1.931835
SOS she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body EOS	2.551754

SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	17.391628
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	1.522916
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	1.842083
SOS though lydia had never been a favourite with them TITLE and TITLE gardiner could not but be deeply affected EOS	5.296740

SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	3.146705
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	1.852823
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	1.975825
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	2.172733
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	2.107965
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	6.800479

SOS no no this is not likely EOS	31.490979
SOS his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her EOS	3.485570
SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	8.496955
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	120.837468
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	2.285057
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	2.476010
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	6.239453
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	1.695485
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	2.729060
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	2.661952
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	22.122126
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	21.681638
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	2.235568
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	3.139952
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	3.259139
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	3.736401
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	7.752718
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	4.022150
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	3.771262
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	14.382479
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	2.952335
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	9.422131
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	6.315680

SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	5.058132
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	40.874216
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	2.847872
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	2.928142
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	4.175090

SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	3.961709

SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	4.005565
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	1.619139
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	2.043619
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	12.146057

SOS my dear brother replied TITLE bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for EOS	4.595886
SOS and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry EOS	3.056161
SOS and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married EOS	2.264594
SOS and above all things keep TITLE bennet from fighting EOS	11.433648
SOS tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day EOS	1.716554
SOS and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses EOS	2.867457
SOS oh brother how kind you are EOS	26.211604
SOS i know you will contrive it all EOS	22.407699
SOS but TITLE gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters EOS	1.721575
SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	1.708498
SOS in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before EOS	3.155173
SOS one came from her books and the other from her toilette EOS	6.823719
SOS the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty EOS	2.130825
SOS as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of EOS	2.001277
SOS but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation EOS	3.128441
SOS then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex EOS	1.455002
SOS elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply EOS	5.330984
SOS mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them EOS	3.564481
SOS in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy EOS	2.184524
SOS after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard EOS	1.829662
SOS give me farther particulars EOS	52.327817
SOS what did colonel forster say EOS	50.309246
SOS had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place EOS	6.104169
SOS they must have seen them together for ever EOS	17.536187
SOS colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm EOS	2.979844
SOS i am so grieved for him EOS	37.582178
SOS his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost EOS	9.868739
SOS he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey EOS	2.381767
SOS and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry EOS	10.668159
SOS did he know of their intending to go off EOS	8.828538
SOS had colonel forster seen denny himself EOS	22.867132
SOS yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it EOS	3.238098
SOS he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before EOS	4.060498
SOS and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married EOS	3.877382
SOS how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains EOS	7.018927
SOS i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right EOS	3.010149
SOS my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be EOS	4.091393
SOS kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step EOS	2.648608
SOS she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks EOS	7.170958
SOS but not before they went to brighton EOS	22.704261
SOS no i believe not EOS	90.725202
SOS and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself EOS	10.113050
SOS does he know his real character EOS	18.170164
SOS i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did EOS	5.954651
SOS he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant EOS	21.550283
SOS and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false EOS	2.884440
SOS oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened EOS	3.297714
SOS perhaps it would have been better replied her sister EOS	13.949123
SOS but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable EOS	3.804140
SOS we acted with the best intentions EOS	25.526472
SOS could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife EOS	6.081679
SOS he brought it with him for us to see EOS	13.692867
SOS jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth EOS	4.888148
SOS these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed EOS	2.279415
SOS i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel EOS	2.881303
SOS i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off EOS	5.565233
SOS you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham EOS	2.313057
SOS what a good joke it will be EOS	17.322744
SOS i can hardly write for laughing EOS	42.587964
SOS pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night EOS	3.597680
SOS tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure EOS	2.454743
SOS i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up EOS	2.254990

SOS cried elizabeth when she had finished it EOS	19.036696
SOS what a letter is this to be written at such a moment EOS	8.182804
SOS but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey EOS	7.455004
SOS whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy EOS	4.513003
SOS my poor father EOS	339.012574
SOS how he must have felt it EOS	31.879199
SOS i never saw any one so shocked EOS	28.823796
SOS he could not speak a word for full ten minutes EOS	12.095104

SOS i do not know EOS	94.910790
SOS i hope there was EOS	166.274745
SOS but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult EOS	10.145906
SOS my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done EOS	3.784044
SOS but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties EOS	5.537590
SOS your attendance upon her has been too much for you EOS	8.693526
SOS you do not look well EOS	62.832452
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone EOS	5.049345
SOS mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them EOS	3.270602
SOS kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on EOS	2.850497
SOS my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me EOS	2.773269
SOS she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us EOS	2.121623
SOS she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours EOS	2.387538
SOS assistance is impossible condolence insufferable EOS	25.288824
SOS let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied EOS	6.206882
SOS she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter EOS	3.115502
SOS he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them EOS	2.315057
SOS his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham EOS	3.943830
SOS it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham EOS	2.214699
SOS if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach EOS	2.010165
SOS i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this EOS	2.798844
SOS the whole party were in hopes of a letter from TITLE bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him EOS	3.275164
SOS his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion EOS	2.880888
SOS they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain EOS	3.861419
SOS TITLE gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off EOS	7.347478
SOS when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on TITLE bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel EOS	2.029748
SOS TITLE gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces EOS	2.887791
SOS she shared in their attendance on TITLE bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom EOS	4.416575
SOS their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them EOS	1.657066
SOS all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light EOS	2.980912
SOS he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family EOS	2.451003
SOS every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness EOS	3.677984
SOS elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them EOS	1.939432
SOS TITLE gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street EOS	2.313614
SOS that TITLE bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as TITLE bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings EOS	2.105100
SOS TITLE gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it EOS	2.730265
SOS he added that TITLE bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon EOS	3.681964
SOS there was also a postscript to this effect EOS	12.400072
SOS i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself EOS	2.264035
SOS if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence EOS	2.736100
SOS at present we have nothing to guide us EOS	13.675615
SOS colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head EOS	4.461267
SOS but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person EOS	3.461984
SOS elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved EOS	2.886414
SOS she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years EOS	3.432952
SOS it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to EOS	2.552263
SOS every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected EOS	2.666736
SOS the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience EOS	5.870131
SOS through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance EOS	2.701575
SOS but before they heard again from TITLE gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from TITLE collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise EOS	1.777088
SOS it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire EOS	2.127912
SOS be assured my dear sir that TITLE collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove EOS	2.055436
SOS no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind EOS	1.988282
SOS the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this EOS	9.299815
SOS and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and TITLE bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age EOS	1.998906
SOS howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by TITLE collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair EOS	2.458193
SOS they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family EOS	2.222728
SOS and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace EOS	2.307686
SOS let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence EOS	2.316269

SOS TITLE gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send EOS	2.803765
SOS it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living EOS	3.560031
SOS his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them EOS	3.423054
SOS there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him EOS	4.082193
SOS and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount EOS	2.330990
SOS colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton EOS	3.523612

SOS the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn EOS	3.923628
SOS TITLE gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world EOS	3.243788

SOS elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley EOS	6.624715
SOS the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better EOS	1.870595

SOS TITLE hill began instantly to express her joy EOS	16.506610
SOS elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom EOS	3.155363
SOS poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful EOS	3.082512
SOS she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained EOS	2.156494
SOS TITLE bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him EOS	2.022808
SOS he now wished it more than ever EOS	21.827057
SOS had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her EOS	2.393522
SOS the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place EOS	3.194533
SOS he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could EOS	2.127795
SOS when first TITLE bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son EOS	3.689488
SOS this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for EOS	2.769736
SOS five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and TITLE bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would EOS	2.593222
SOS this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving EOS	4.064412
SOS TITLE bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income EOS	3.537731
SOS five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on TITLE bennet and the children EOS	5.604320
SOS but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents EOS	4.229570
SOS this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and TITLE bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him EOS	2.894957
SOS in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him EOS	2.192150
SOS he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement EOS	2.984225
SOS he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum EOS	1.816797
SOS that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible EOS	2.362493
SOS when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence EOS	2.672419
SOS his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution EOS	3.791978
SOS he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her EOS	2.908100
SOS the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood EOS	5.306238
SOS it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy EOS	12.719746
SOS to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house EOS	2.560144
SOS but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain EOS	1.803904
SOS it was a fortnight since TITLE bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high EOS	2.483974
SOS no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph EOS	7.760261
SOS the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants EOS	2.251364
SOS she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance EOS	2.240316
SOS haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off EOS	2.051186
SOS i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful EOS	4.101344
SOS her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained EOS	5.578131

SOS into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance EOS	5.028800
SOS i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn EOS	6.597700
SOS a long dispute followed this declaration but TITLE bennet was firm it soon led to another and TITLE bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter EOS	2.145889
SOS he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion EOS	4.611778
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly comprehend it EOS	31.147112
SOS that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible EOS	2.430512
SOS she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place EOS	2.100665
SOS elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make TITLE darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot EOS	1.677011
SOS she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means EOS	9.557430
SOS there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much EOS	2.600865
SOS not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them EOS	2.716769
SOS had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that TITLE darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned EOS	2.055511
SOS from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink EOS	9.582154
SOS the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this EOS	2.857533
SOS she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what EOS	5.297887
SOS she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it EOS	4.928292
SOS she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence EOS	5.146498
SOS she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet EOS	5.826416
SOS what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received EOS	2.396612
SOS he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex EOS	5.570942
SOS but while he was mortal there must be a triumph EOS	12.273706
SOS she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her EOS	4.301609
SOS his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes EOS	5.086024
SOS it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance EOS	2.143872
SOS but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was EOS	4.173160
SOS an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family EOS	2.969537
SOS how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine EOS	6.349113

SOS TITLE gardiner soon wrote again to his brother EOS	15.484984
SOS to TITLE bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again EOS	2.487064

SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	1.699920

SOS they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world EOS	7.481559
SOS nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world EOS	2.611349

SOS mamma do the people here abouts know i am married to day EOS	4.832827
SOS i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing EOS	1.635152
SOS elizabeth could bear it no longer EOS	30.341112
SOS she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour EOS	3.523790

SOS jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman EOS	3.944016
SOS it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first EOS	4.199438
SOS her ease and good spirits increased EOS	32.420959
SOS she longed to see TITLE philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called TITLE wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to TITLE hill and the two housemaids EOS	2.082226
SOS well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband EOS	5.058912

SOS TITLE wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight EOS	4.073267
SOS no one but TITLE bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home EOS	2.222564
SOS these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not EOS	2.466786
SOS wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him EOS	3.439353
SOS she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion EOS	1.738696
SOS lydia was exceedingly fond of him EOS	21.257834
SOS he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him EOS	4.173901
SOS he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country EOS	3.394673
SOS one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe EOS	2.636354
SOS you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it EOS	5.607764
SOS are not you curious to hear how it was managed EOS	7.449793

SOS clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish EOS	5.824167

SOS well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss EOS	10.361389
SOS i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted EOS	4.209772
SOS and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon EOS	3.150672
SOS however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham EOS	3.055365
SOS i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat EOS	7.954815
SOS well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them EOS	2.427261
SOS if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight EOS	3.673431
SOS not one party or scheme or any thing EOS	11.406822
SOS to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open EOS	4.839961
SOS well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man TITLE stone EOS	2.947552
SOS and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it EOS	5.100292
SOS well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day EOS	2.811160
SOS but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out EOS	4.829740
SOS however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for TITLE darcy might have done as well EOS	3.343998
SOS TITLE darcy EOS	717.240067
SOS repeated elizabeth in utter amazement EOS	28.385746
SOS oh yes EOS	672.334912
SOS he was to come there with wickham you know EOS	14.830569
SOS but gracious me EOS	433.487325
SOS i quite forgot EOS	502.104981
SOS i ought not to have said a word about it EOS	12.345929
SOS i promised them so faithfully EOS	63.172736
SOS what will wickham say EOS	95.892956
SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	35.440217
SOS if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject EOS	5.328757
SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	14.782423
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	4.408125
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	3.085055
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	4.529149
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	4.013478
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	24.370792
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	3.078619
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	3.688097
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	3.558559
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	2.532694
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	2.286668
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	2.098523
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	2.286350
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	1.980758
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	5.849699
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	2.354127
SOS gracechurch street sept EOS	140.739426
SOS NUM EOS	16172.826337
SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	2.283529
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	6.504184
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	2.561535
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	10.783452
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	2.472647
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	7.251039
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	4.195135
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	8.189357
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	3.240246
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	3.270129
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	2.526009
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	2.550472
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	2.769565
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	19.074196
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	3.616685
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	8.849083
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	2.171823
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	2.414724
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	3.860995
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	3.104387
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	5.772717
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	3.246126
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	2.560765
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	6.712543
SOS they were in street EOS	131.432254
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	10.992610
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	2.623697
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	8.018102
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	3.930602
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	5.639810
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	2.003787
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	2.256897
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	3.713976
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	4.541351
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	6.751578
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	3.456679
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	2.837285
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	4.016314
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	8.366423
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	3.829446
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	2.494323
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	3.091954
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	2.438218
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	3.449157
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	39.931650
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	4.094559
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	8.440080
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	5.537259
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	32.125039
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	5.498895
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	5.231287
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	3.164262
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	3.455947
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	1.712365
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	6.130430
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	5.801957
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	2.671680
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	5.856433
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	3.022477
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	2.583881
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	2.520524
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	2.173342
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	16.062263
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	3.387227
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	5.185826
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	1.915374
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	3.118658
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	5.871581
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	3.326900
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	4.785911
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	4.856918
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	2.628646
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	4.430543
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	2.626316
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	7.948128
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	57.277528
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	3.559423
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	7.453066

SOS gardiner EOS	9339.034043
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	2.820410
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	1.966710
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	1.523461
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	6.213645
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	10.888885
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	1.945725
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	30.368497
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	9.165613
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	31.925562
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	23.125257
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	4.829840
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	1.953969
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	3.853466
SOS they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him EOS	6.675688
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him EOS	3.155402
SOS for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him EOS	8.060393
SOS proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself EOS	3.962916
SOS she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again EOS	7.221931
SOS it was hardly enough but it pleased her EOS	14.465044
SOS she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	2.347538
SOS she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham EOS	2.625146
SOS i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister EOS	9.008410

SOS and it was not wholly without foundation EOS	41.775814

SOS elizabeth did not know what to make of it EOS	19.808175
SOS had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it EOS	1.957825
SOS yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation EOS	2.281644
SOS i will leave him to himself EOS	34.939055
SOS in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it EOS	3.041609

SOS consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see TITLE bingley in consequence of it before they did EOS	2.129840
SOS as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister EOS	3.312472

SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	388.394235
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	2.639013
SOS she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before EOS	3.868081

SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	11.803269
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	2.545659
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	27.056847
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	2.274488
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	2.814315
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	1.710064
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	2.589090
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	2.057507
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	51.692476
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	4.282939
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	2.362993
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	5.051111
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	2.280764
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	3.045820
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	14.907284
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	3.845103
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	5.787844
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	11.811198
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	2.843662
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	2.172106
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	2.192892
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	3.770861
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	4.343092
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	6.588896
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	1.861945
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	3.444324
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	9.463714
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	21.159360
SOS said she EOS	711.270567
SOS yet why did he come EOS	38.263034
SOS she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak EOS	4.031393
SOS she enquired after his sister but could do no more EOS	9.121228
SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	6.636905
SOS he readily agreed to it EOS	54.346054

SOS it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it EOS	3.124238
SOS did you see it EOS	67.855789
SOS bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations EOS	10.738122
SOS elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes EOS	20.530281
SOS how TITLE darcy looked therefore she could not tell EOS	15.470148
SOS it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time TITLE bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me EOS	3.201598
SOS they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long EOS	3.312852
SOS his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars EOS	3.575897
SOS thank heaven EOS	639.562275
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	6.321888
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	4.041971
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	2.395780
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	54.476710
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	2.638325

SOS elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention EOS	8.772249
SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	2.272231
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	3.130536
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	3.961109
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	4.340902
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	7.803911
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	2.203568
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	2.601899
SOS he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty EOS	3.969759
SOS jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever EOS	3.000486
SOS but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent EOS	5.729691
SOS when the gentlemen rose to go away TITLE bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time EOS	3.076099
SOS you are quite a visit in my debt TITLE bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned EOS	2.561665
SOS i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement EOS	3.682585
SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	3.372607
SOS they then went away EOS	105.513583
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	1.814854
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	2.567188
SOS TITLE darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her EOS	17.558352
SOS why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all EOS	3.483439

SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	2.636084
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	2.103122
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	3.854435
SOS it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour EOS	4.674708
SOS TITLE darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them EOS	5.716083
SOS he was on one side of her mother EOS	20.421347
SOS she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage EOS	3.868117
SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	2.680215
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	2.274128
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	2.123027
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	2.327735

SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	1.893278

SOS TITLE bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual EOS	12.832446
SOS bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter EOS	4.737522
SOS his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter EOS	1.837249
SOS he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and TITLE bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband EOS	2.517132

SOS bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and TITLE bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on EOS	3.212767
SOS the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected EOS	9.494015
SOS there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him EOS	2.165269
SOS bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening TITLE bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter EOS	2.658615
SOS elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes EOS	2.684515
SOS but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her EOS	2.666686
SOS on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all EOS	1.738250
SOS their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse EOS	4.820826
SOS not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room EOS	2.382903
SOS jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world EOS	2.603779

SOS she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty EOS	3.428737

SOS he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister EOS	3.996487
SOS elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship EOS	6.382647
SOS they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself EOS	1.630742
SOS it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever EOS	2.471958
SOS kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon EOS	6.227110
SOS TITLE bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when TITLE bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was EOS	2.042159
SOS not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you EOS	2.320061
SOS you will be a very happy woman EOS	30.991109

SOS at that moment she cared for no other EOS	14.964466
SOS her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense EOS	3.288173
SOS mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter EOS	2.948394
SOS bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept EOS	1.899170
SOS elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur EOS	2.011596
SOS in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief EOS	2.763654
SOS he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring EOS	3.405818

SOS that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter EOS	4.935232
SOS good girl EOS	1223.366627
SOS it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard EOS	5.107813
SOS would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again EOS	2.149903
SOS he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty EOS	5.866915
SOS this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities EOS	3.196828
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him EOS	2.965426

SOS one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn EOS	1.907018

SOS the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them EOS	2.985694

SOS your ladyship wants TITLE darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable EOS	2.633312

SOS allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged EOS	2.430008
SOS you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these EOS	3.380206
SOS how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine EOS	2.555462

SOS you are then resolved to have him EOS	19.263657

SOS it is well EOS	408.055680
SOS you refuse then to oblige me EOS	29.394957
SOS you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude EOS	7.186087

SOS neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance EOS	3.047764
SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	5.002517
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	2.157238
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	34.422112
SOS this is your final resolve EOS	49.164107
SOS very well EOS	611.791289
SOS i shall now know how to act EOS	28.030925
SOS do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified EOS	6.568085
SOS i came to try you EOS	63.172736
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	5.606352
SOS in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet EOS	2.661548
SOS i send no compliments to your mother EOS	22.407699
SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	51.639850
SOS i am most seriously displeased EOS	63.172736
SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	3.831291
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	7.586630
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	2.807069
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	9.226284
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	24.436754
SOS and her calling here was prodigiously civil EOS	19.280213
SOS for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well EOS	5.418827
SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	3.543904
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	9.776222
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	3.596956
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	2.945896
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	2.383404
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	15.539525
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	1.745160
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	4.966670
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	1.957427
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	3.839108
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	2.071031
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	1.825373
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	2.417712
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	2.067782
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	13.745940
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	2.869605
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	2.963397
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	7.777747
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	2.993838
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	2.332077
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	3.037615
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	4.749457
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	2.843578
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	4.203054
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	6.782504
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	4.878734
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	7.751364
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	6.807080
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	8.942278
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	1.871985
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	2.677110
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	25.526472
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	231.601375
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	21.024758
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	11.354309
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	2.769850
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	4.943037
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	17.322744
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	2.404897
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	2.011016
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	6.904544
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	2.316196
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	2.014240
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	8.159324
SOS but now it comes out EOS	57.277528
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	13.321108
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	3.520032
SOS mr EOS	16172.826337
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	21.454733
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	13.446998
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	2.164511
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	2.910420
SOS it is admirable EOS	408.055680
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	4.840250
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	4.798404
SOS are you not diverted EOS	72.198242
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes EOS	9475.752486
SOS pray read on EOS	203.058559
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	1.803389
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	2.078093
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	2.019972
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	2.517951
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	3.278803
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	2.386803
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	16.777332
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	3.736913
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	9.088387
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	4.453975
SOS for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn EOS	2.941648
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	29.000952
SOS but it is so strange EOS	65.949523
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	19.195567
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	3.126393
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	4.671596
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	2.128137
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	9.505775
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	13.955385
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	2.838131
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	5.956350
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	7.671984
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	2.447936
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	2.003828
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	2.154913
SOS it was agreed to EOS	140.853034
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	4.253822
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	6.823719
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	5.547621
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	2.283955
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	2.150743
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	1.923647
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	5.070070
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	3.127293
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	4.533501
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	2.650532
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	9.188016
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	31.146327
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	2.934992
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	2.374701
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	5.505889
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	3.122761
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	32.125039
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	5.850243
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	13.973145
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	5.321453
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	4.645512
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	3.683142
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	1.758567
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	2.276054
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	1.837073
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	14.371413
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	4.715319
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	1.577007
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	7.568192
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	4.366137
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	2.804882
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	3.223603
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	3.072350
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	11.207027
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	2.693040
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	408.055680
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	29.487588
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	3.796201
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	3.179835
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	18.502552
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	2.898582
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	3.572835
SOS those were your words EOS	60.108878
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	2.598595
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	6.196363
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	7.685111
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	75.864241
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	6.704195
SOS the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me EOS	2.849456
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS do not repeat what i then said EOS	16.424782
SOS these recollections will not do at all EOS	16.398212
SOS i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it EOS	7.713585
SOS darcy mentioned his letter EOS	73.136196
SOS did it said he did it soon make you think better of me EOS	4.978878
SOS did you on reading it give any credit to its contents EOS	5.796438
SOS she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed EOS	3.689142
SOS i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary EOS	6.055011
SOS i hope you have destroyed the letter EOS	30.232606

SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	2.009683
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	2.628464
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	7.307201
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	55.186468
SOS but think no more of the letter EOS	28.823160
SOS the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten EOS	2.712154
SOS you must learn some of my philosophy EOS	19.263657
SOS think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure EOS	6.185439
SOS i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind EOS	7.948128
SOS your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance EOS	2.551660
SOS but with me it is not so EOS	28.948746
SOS painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled EOS	6.333718
SOS i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle EOS	5.877258
SOS as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper EOS	4.005454
SOS i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit EOS	5.250636
SOS unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own EOS	1.707778
SOS such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth EOS	2.527696

SOS you blamed me for coming EOS	51.639850
SOS no indeed i felt nothing but surprise EOS	16.733237
SOS your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you EOS	6.618393
SOS my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due EOS	3.551322
SOS my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to EOS	1.897386
SOS how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you EOS	3.105070
SOS he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend EOS	1.664378
SOS she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther EOS	4.193500
SOS after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home EOS	2.352620
SOS what could become of TITLE bingley and jane EOS	19.071376

SOS i guessed as much EOS	144.755683
SOS and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case EOS	5.043312
SOS on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago EOS	3.240376
SOS i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent EOS	4.364100
SOS his surprise was great EOS	97.392010
SOS he had never had the slightest suspicion EOS	21.056095
SOS i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together EOS	2.427536
SOS elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend EOS	6.481264
SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	2.311018
SOS from the former EOS	231.601375
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	3.037706
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	6.516109
SOS it did EOS	3026.629336
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	34.547307
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	2.759686
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	4.799899
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	3.139033
SOS he was angry EOS	400.637889
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	4.047649
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	30.710499
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	3.033842
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	4.505557
SOS in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house EOS	3.123299
SOS in the hall they parted EOS	54.525220
SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	12.640907
SOS was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table EOS	3.877012
SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	4.093215

SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	12.382158
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	9.494015
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	2.174136
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	1.971646
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	13.675615

SOS very very much EOS	206.855690
SOS nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight EOS	8.237463

SOS it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began EOS	5.751382
SOS but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley EOS	4.829740
SOS another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment EOS	2.842600
SOS when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish EOS	6.621713
SOS now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself EOS	6.010524
SOS i always had a value for him EOS	22.407699

SOS how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton EOS	5.932672
SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	6.717712
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	14.213177
SOS she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend EOS	3.666564
SOS but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage EOS	5.103454
SOS all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation EOS	6.951218

SOS what shall we do with him EOS	26.035261
SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	4.354689
SOS elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet EOS	2.750570
SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	1.956967
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	5.374326
SOS it is a nice long walk and TITLE darcy has never seen the view EOS	6.336895
SOS it may do very well for the others replied TITLE bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty EOS	5.003993
SOS wont it kitty EOS	127.172428
SOS kitty owned that she had rather stay at home EOS	12.224339
SOS darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented EOS	4.074593

SOS during their walk it was resolved that TITLE bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening EOS	3.522907

SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	2.584534
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	1.896184
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	2.891489
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	1.755287
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	2.558420
SOS she was gone directly EOS	148.698982

SOS have not you always hated him EOS	20.061487
SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	3.602633
SOS it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to TITLE darcy EOS	2.252764
SOS or in other words you are determined to have him EOS	7.729396
SOS he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane EOS	4.926161
SOS but will they make you happy EOS	32.125039
SOS have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference EOS	4.706285

SOS you know not what you are about EOS	24.097883
SOS elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that TITLE darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match EOS	1.651173

SOS i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter EOS	2.956705
SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	1.857403
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	2.660993
SOS every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time EOS	2.350262
SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	4.146350
SOS its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it TITLE bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable EOS	2.729387
SOS nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them EOS	2.054535

SOS who could have done less for her EOS	15.260929
SOS but make a virtue of it by all means EOS	12.158665
SOS my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last EOS	2.004639
SOS what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here EOS	4.861192
SOS why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me EOS	4.513759
SOS because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement EOS	5.201620
SOS but i was embarrassed EOS	154.569264
SOS and so was i EOS	113.809612
SOS you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner EOS	6.512665
SOS a man who had felt less might EOS	21.865919
SOS how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it EOS	3.931262
SOS but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself EOS	5.486510
SOS i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you EOS	9.279542
SOS my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect EOS	5.087767
SOS too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject EOS	2.326385
SOS this will never do EOS	93.279696
SOS you need not distress yourself EOS	57.958659
SOS the moral will be perfectly fair EOS	31.117118
SOS lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts EOS	4.595550
SOS i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude EOS	4.509965
SOS i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s EOS	6.981886
SOS my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing EOS	3.969390
SOS lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use EOS	3.638962
SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	9.308900
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	7.554564
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	9.538966
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	2.978446
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	2.352499
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	4.448263
SOS i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth EOS	10.220367
SOS but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly EOS	4.864681
SOS and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did EOS	2.907551
SOS but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected EOS	7.522281
SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	1.612183
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	29.394957
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	2.175841
SOS you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last EOS	4.198181
SOS i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes EOS	9.625546
SOS how could i be so silly as to wish it EOS	8.500119
SOS your idea of the ponies is delightful EOS	18.870643
SOS we will go round the park every day EOS	13.420399
SOS i am the happiest creature in the world EOS	16.592442
SOS perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice EOS	4.610622
SOS i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh EOS	7.948128
SOS TITLE darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me EOS	4.956077
SOS you are all to come to pemberley at christmas EOS	14.065063
SOS your s c EOS	152.190982
SOS TITLE darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what TITLE bennet sent to TITLE collins in reply to his last EOS	3.237370
SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	6.951106
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	13.973639
SOS console lady catherine as well as you can EOS	13.299878
SOS but if i were you i would stand by the nephew EOS	8.786561
SOS he has more to give EOS	54.346054
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	88.280573
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	4.121519
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	4.088521
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	2.464818
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	3.566305
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	2.775060
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	2.224485
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	13.569849
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	2.108595
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	2.314564
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	22.961328
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	2.487692
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	18.170164
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	5.886012
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	2.007801
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	3.150360
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	1.601285
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	2.618065
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	4.814644
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	1.876650
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	3.478951
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	6.879179
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	11.090706
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	3.026335
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	2.276075
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	4.203567
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	5.807832
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	2.415457
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	2.128460
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	2.779497
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	1.949953
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	4.622276
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	2.313939
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	2.479496
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	9.651091
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	5.053248
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	3.809375
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	3.036706
SOS any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to TITLE darcy about it if you had rather not EOS	2.543645
SOS yours c EOS	639.524640
SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	2.688458
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	2.745916
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	1.703074
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	3.212101
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	3.200958
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	2.464693
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	2.949455
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	1.687705
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	1.693021
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	2.778603
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	6.979567
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	2.174502
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	3.119713
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	6.366650
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	2.221321
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	1.971876
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	1.763901
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	7.478147
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	2.475315
