SOS jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail EOS	146.160429

SOS it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said TITLE bennet and nothing can clear TITLE collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn EOS	671.131825
SOS but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself EOS	173.277867

SOS dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance EOS	543.107176

SOS my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england EOS	816.132522
SOS as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch EOS	450.930432

SOS if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day EOS	489.244801

SOS TITLE wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker EOS	649.686802

SOS a clear ten thousand per annum EOS	421.695852

SOS as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable EOS	94.217628

SOS i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge EOS	94.443596

SOS here you are in your own family EOS	76.163910

SOS you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one EOS	231.424908
SOS i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen EOS	16.851707
SOS the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen EOS	14.140795
SOS i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man EOS	18.243428
SOS wickham only shook his head EOS	17.201073

SOS elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry EOS	19.630775
SOS TITLE wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry EOS	12.947083
SOS it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire EOS	16.730828
SOS i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them EOS	14.923162

SOS how could his will be disregarded EOS	23.585741

SOS there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law EOS	20.834707
SOS a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but TITLE darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing EOS	16.284821
SOS certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it EOS	20.156491
SOS i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely EOS	18.226839

SOS my father began life in the profession which your uncle TITLE philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late TITLE darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property EOS	19.468114
SOS he was most highly esteemed by TITLE darcy a most intimate confidential friend EOS	14.424963
SOS TITLE darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendance and when immediately before my father s death TITLE darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself EOS	16.614818

SOS family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this EOS	21.880905
SOS not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive EOS	15.425871
SOS he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers EOS	13.656195

SOS it had not been very great he had lost every point but when TITLE philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy EOS	17.456599
SOS i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object EOS	15.532156
SOS there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters EOS	12.972527
SOS TITLE wickham s attention was caught and after observing TITLE collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh EOS	12.891691
SOS lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living EOS	13.860886

SOS i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent EOS	21.604441
SOS she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class EOS	17.387965
SOS elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of TITLE wickham s attentions EOS	15.510771

SOS lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and TITLE collins in describing the civility of TITLE and TITLE philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house EOS	13.194662
SOS elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between TITLE wickham and herself EOS	18.624981

SOS the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained EOS	15.471877
SOS they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea EOS	21.373225

SOS the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with TITLE wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball EOS	17.629149

SOS i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her EOS	16.312328

SOS this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make EOS	16.558941

SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	18.624106
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	31.637451
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	18.116004
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	19.063709
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	23.641341
SOS very well EOS	35.117246
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	30.991271
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	11.806621
SOS but now we may be silent EOS	23.384894
SOS do you talk by rule then while you are dancing EOS	17.981046
SOS sometimes EOS	147.903715
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	32.413582
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	18.321719
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	20.035013
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	20.771685
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	14.413447
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	17.766798
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	18.888576
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	13.705924
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	19.389876
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	21.079309
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	14.473894
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	28.380368
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	15.586191
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	14.898393
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	17.547294
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	14.942268
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	16.006714
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	13.275592
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	27.139862
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	20.637213
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	18.316122
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	20.528893
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	16.604212
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	12.281607
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	16.673563
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	16.590939
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	16.002131
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	20.066511
SOS we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine EOS	16.197810
SOS what think you of books EOS	32.508799
SOS said he smiling EOS	39.528807
SOS books oh EOS	36.232904
SOS no EOS	73.612260
SOS i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings EOS	17.052036
SOS i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject EOS	20.684421
SOS we may compare our different opinions EOS	13.464579
SOS no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else EOS	19.372687
SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	16.777655
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	28.537879
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	14.794643
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	19.468123
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	21.452123
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	21.907860
SOS i hope not EOS	25.359050
SOS it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first EOS	14.768324
SOS may i ask to what these questions tend EOS	20.859122
SOS merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity EOS	20.063954
SOS i am trying to make it out EOS	16.657923
SOS and what is your success EOS	28.140005
SOS she shook her head EOS	17.592679
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	16.771970
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	15.977031
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	15.481772
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	19.701490
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	12.112533
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	15.803643
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	13.911856
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	18.657487
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	16.454088
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	18.855525
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	21.414589
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	13.616369
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	18.152258
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	14.408826
SOS excuse my interference EOS	34.997505
SOS it was kindly meant EOS	21.522471
SOS insolent girl EOS	43.557608
SOS said elizabeth to herself EOS	33.629349
SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	16.441171
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	20.153019
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	17.701316
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	15.291089
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	16.361021
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	21.625935
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	20.367874
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	21.292749
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	16.901962
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	13.067070
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	19.929567
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	26.674695
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	19.636676
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	13.280339
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	27.161326
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	19.453773
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	16.752081
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	17.413307
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	18.260366
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	15.307295
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	17.997052
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	18.369066
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	15.444957
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	13.342698
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	16.448484
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	17.919556
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	16.478234
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	15.687232
SOS indeed i am EOS	33.327087
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	14.647419
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	18.746561
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	16.633178
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	14.986940
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	12.906896
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	17.826849
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	12.997361
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	16.375737
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	17.099913
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	20.964698
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	15.592125
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	16.259840
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	19.870219
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	18.107123
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	19.152747
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	16.971014
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	24.064902
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	21.232420
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	16.342371
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	18.985138
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	16.138633
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	16.776248
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	12.841687
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	18.798769
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	17.974841
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	16.103738
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	13.771750
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	14.663136
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	18.357362
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	23.138366
SOS i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear EOS	16.610473
SOS for heaven s sake madam speak lower EOS	16.590310
SOS what advantage can it be to you to offend TITLE darcy EOS	23.376889
SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	19.200003
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	32.520758
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	20.943882
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	12.612289
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	16.400964
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	13.403525
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	12.860910
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	20.907420
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	14.296807
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	15.159686
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	15.545062
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	15.553154
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	22.614194
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	22.166593
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	14.041442
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	12.696669
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	13.670557
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	18.871622
SOS let the other young ladies have time to exhibit EOS	22.590364
SOS mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good EOS	17.584060
SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	33.129460
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	15.337772
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	16.186647
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	23.166500
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	15.778360
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	17.627439
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	12.880063
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	14.789513
SOS and with a bow to TITLE darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room EOS	17.676690
SOS many stared EOS	48.264640
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	14.204864
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	19.240856
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	16.383346
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	16.214109
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	17.382634
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	18.385206
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	21.307587
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	15.975098
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	15.483431
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	15.871224
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	18.759471
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	17.510498
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	12.791209
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	16.328176
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	28.103230
SOS TITLE bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene EOS	13.469513
SOS TITLE bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other EOS	16.383677

SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	18.334331
SOS bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time EOS	17.694294
SOS TITLE bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months EOS	12.592114
SOS of having another daughter married to TITLE collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure EOS	20.230200
SOS elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by TITLE bingley and netherfield EOS	21.930200

SOS i am going away myself EOS	14.251296
SOS no no nonsense lizzy EOS	16.750865
SOS i desire you will stay where you are EOS	24.923457
SOS and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing TITLE collins EOS	13.006428
SOS elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion EOS	14.081493
SOS TITLE bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone TITLE collins began EOS	17.123850
SOS believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections EOS	15.682299
SOS you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address EOS	17.528782
SOS you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken EOS	14.840045
SOS almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life EOS	21.037623
SOS but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did EOS	16.417304
SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	15.085601
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	16.475659
SOS twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too EOS	17.565504
SOS on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while TITLE jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said TITLE collins you must marry EOS	12.711786
SOS a clergyman like you must marry EOS	23.569083
SOS chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way EOS	15.077947
SOS this is my advice EOS	30.242372
SOS find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her EOS	27.281055
SOS allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer EOS	15.333493
SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	15.866593
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	16.030620
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	16.326527
SOS this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem EOS	20.338567
SOS and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection EOS	22.696383
SOS to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents EOS	17.915751
SOS which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to EOS	20.460009
SOS on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married EOS	14.904486
SOS it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now EOS	14.878301
SOS you are too hasty sir she cried EOS	15.146648
SOS you forget that i have made no answer EOS	20.938682
SOS let me do it without farther loss of time EOS	19.390787
SOS accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me EOS	22.805317
SOS i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them EOS	16.824642
SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	15.058662
SOS i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long EOS	15.211581
SOS upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration EOS	14.674830
SOS i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time EOS	17.111615
SOS i am perfectly serious in my refusal EOS	19.061284
SOS you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so EOS	21.484311
SOS nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation EOS	21.455970
SOS were it certain that lady catherine would think so said TITLE collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you EOS	19.010909
SOS and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications EOS	17.130437
SOS indeed TITLE collins all praise of me will be unnecessary EOS	27.427934
SOS you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say EOS	16.433037
SOS i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise EOS	18.064810
SOS in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach EOS	17.375191
SOS this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled EOS	17.429508
SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	18.737363
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	18.327971
SOS if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one EOS	19.354822
SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	16.081079
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	16.124796
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	16.882652
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	12.913998
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	17.275314
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	11.788888
SOS i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere EOS	19.489257
SOS i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible EOS	20.183593
SOS my feelings in every respect forbid it EOS	18.372568
SOS can i speak plainer EOS	29.185245
SOS do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart EOS	16.566211
SOS you are uniformly charming EOS	16.501313
SOS cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable EOS	15.670456
SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	13.504617
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	15.476706
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	15.025253
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	17.260977
SOS but depend upon it TITLE collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason EOS	18.451179
SOS i will speak to her about it myself directly EOS	26.506163
SOS she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it EOS	17.981803
SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	18.619182
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	14.891764
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	19.476511
SOS lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these EOS	21.292455
SOS in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived EOS	19.977061
SOS i will go directly to TITLE bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure EOS	18.580850
SOS she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh EOS	16.654930
SOS TITLE bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar EOS	20.017540
SOS you must come and make lizzy marry TITLE collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her EOS	20.149641
SOS TITLE bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication EOS	17.670052
SOS i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech EOS	17.922450
SOS of what are you talking EOS	34.962484
SOS of TITLE collins and lizzy EOS	24.997653

SOS it seems an hopeless business EOS	15.723054

SOS let her be called down EOS	23.277655

SOS i have sent for you on an affair of importance EOS	19.396952
SOS i understand that TITLE collins has made you an offer of marriage EOS	16.113934
SOS is it true EOS	40.293242
SOS elizabeth replied that it was EOS	28.280813

SOS elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but TITLE bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed EOS	18.190200
SOS what do you mean TITLE bennet by talking in this way EOS	19.335271
SOS you promised me to insist upon her marrying him EOS	18.093272
SOS my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request EOS	17.699884
SOS first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room EOS	23.356752
SOS i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be EOS	19.946400
SOS not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did TITLE bennet give up the point EOS	22.179039
SOS she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns EOS	13.951566
SOS she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks EOS	14.033004
SOS though her manner varied however her determination never did EOS	15.774189
SOS TITLE collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed EOS	11.512857
SOS he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way EOS	17.849609
SOS his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret EOS	20.155555
SOS while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them EOS	22.855265
SOS she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here EOS	18.504805
SOS what do you think has happened this morning EOS	18.406765
SOS TITLE collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him EOS	19.362472
SOS charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where TITLE bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family EOS	18.170438
SOS pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves EOS	14.293128
SOS charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth EOS	19.991856
SOS aye there she comes continued TITLE bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way EOS	15.112861
SOS but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead EOS	16.223993
SOS i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you EOS	17.228508
SOS i have done with you from this very day EOS	24.265175

SOS her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation EOS	12.754286
SOS she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by TITLE collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let TITLE collins and me have a little conversation together EOS	18.587759
SOS elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of TITLE collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear EOS	17.874895
SOS in a doleful voice TITLE bennet thus began the projected conversation EOS	14.007248
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS TITLE collins EOS	16.230147
SOS my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point EOS	16.882658
SOS far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter EOS	15.913592
SOS resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned EOS	15.762557
SOS perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation EOS	14.716181
SOS you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and TITLE bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf EOS	13.229346
SOS my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own EOS	13.857091
SOS but we are all liable to error EOS	15.573488
SOS i have certainly meant well through the whole affair EOS	16.343450
SOS my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise EOS	17.467501
SOS the discussion of TITLE collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother EOS	16.207806
SOS as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence EOS	12.621889
SOS he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend EOS	18.375214
SOS the morrow produced no abatement of TITLE bennet s ill humour or ill health EOS	13.927353
SOS TITLE collins was also in the same state of angry pride EOS	16.991234
SOS elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it EOS	17.326451
SOS he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay EOS	22.341748
SOS after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if TITLE wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball EOS	16.178715
SOS he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over EOS	19.077490
SOS to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed EOS	22.054516
SOS i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet TITLE darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself EOS	20.205278
SOS she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her EOS	17.281172
SOS his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother EOS	17.699951
SOS soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately EOS	22.155372
SOS the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages EOS	12.151258
SOS jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs EOS	17.192367
SOS when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal EOS	17.419996
SOS the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again EOS	18.248526
SOS you shall hear what she says EOS	24.828096
SOS she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where TITLE hurst had a house EOS	15.340956
SOS the next was in these words EOS	28.040646
SOS i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence EOS	14.097324
SOS i depend on you for that EOS	41.193474
SOS to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent TITLE bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his EOS	17.160714
SOS it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country EOS	16.707756
SOS but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters EOS	16.904747
SOS TITLE bingley will not be detained in london by them EOS	19.638153
SOS caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter EOS	14.257998
SOS i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel EOS	16.909455
SOS many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair EOS	22.245005
SOS i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you EOS	13.940694
SOS it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter EOS	17.638858
SOS it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should EOS	20.122761
SOS why will you think so EOS	32.130469

SOS TITLE darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again EOS	17.984206
SOS i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister EOS	13.747959
SOS i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable EOS	17.166372
SOS my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart EOS	15.633669

SOS but the case is this EOS	26.491760
SOS we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way EOS	16.496241
SOS but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend EOS	17.228700
SOS if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy EOS	16.894217
SOS but i know the foundation is unjust EOS	15.748198

SOS a thousand things may arise in six months EOS	14.945720
SOS the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt EOS	18.763428
SOS it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one EOS	12.775131
SOS she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect EOS	18.471823
SOS jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart EOS	18.346044
SOS they agreed that TITLE bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together EOS	16.576516
SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	20.127945
SOS the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to TITLE collins EOS	17.606231
SOS elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her EOS	17.328729
SOS it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express EOS	24.232571
SOS charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time EOS	23.011606
SOS this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of TITLE collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself EOS	16.398115
SOS such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon EOS	16.743999
SOS but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet EOS	14.984683
SOS he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday EOS	15.801149
SOS his reception however was of the most flattering kind EOS	23.970491
SOS miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane EOS	16.063063
SOS but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there EOS	17.021026
SOS in as short a time as TITLE collins s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness EOS	18.238206
SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	12.951366
SOS sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity EOS	16.099646
SOS TITLE collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair EOS	15.541370
SOS lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer TITLE bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever TITLE collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st EOS	14.870982

SOS she had gained her point and had time to consider of it EOS	19.071194

SOS TITLE collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary EOS	17.299573
SOS but still he would be her husband EOS	25.228806
SOS without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want EOS	13.135445
SOS this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it EOS	15.947139
SOS the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person EOS	20.125682
SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	18.785496
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	18.183128
SOS a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love EOS	12.278475
SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	17.237088
SOS my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible EOS	15.302804

SOS risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence EOS	17.535844
SOS believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire EOS	17.193466
SOS as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth EOS	13.872677
SOS with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return EOS	15.322563
SOS TITLE bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him EOS	16.835835
SOS she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her s he might become a very agreeable companion EOS	16.363939
SOS but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away EOS	19.433701
SOS miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before EOS	17.741948
SOS the possibility of TITLE collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to TITLE collins EOS	15.624406
SOS my dear charlotte impossible EOS	16.594738

SOS do you think it incredible that TITLE collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you EOS	17.211403
SOS but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness EOS	17.168467

SOS elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family EOS	14.024285
SOS charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard EOS	23.577727
SOS it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match EOS	19.029457
SOS the strangeness of TITLE collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted EOS	15.055251
SOS she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage EOS	15.071113
SOS charlotte the wife of TITLE collins was a most humiliating picture EOS	17.983083

SOS elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family EOS	12.935186
SOS with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for TITLE bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord EOS	12.202583

SOS elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of TITLE collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london EOS	16.337305
SOS TITLE bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent EOS	14.188821
SOS in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that TITLE collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off EOS	15.133541
SOS two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day EOS	16.852843

SOS TITLE bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter EOS	15.977932
SOS jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable EOS	23.675757
SOS kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for TITLE collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton EOS	17.205867
SOS lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on TITLE bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though TITLE bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away EOS	15.523125
SOS between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again EOS	16.585023

SOS you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness EOS	11.317896
SOS i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together EOS	17.030514
SOS but enough of this EOS	36.320919
SOS you alluded to something else EOS	19.883982
SOS you mentioned two instances EOS	24.165996
SOS i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk EOS	17.245266
SOS we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured EOS	13.695296
SOS we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect EOS	16.576850

SOS if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine EOS	16.740380
SOS i am far from attributing any part of TITLE bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery EOS	15.614576
SOS thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business EOS	20.199277
SOS and do you impute it to either of those EOS	29.034262
SOS yes to the last EOS	40.228365
SOS but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem EOS	17.702962

SOS yes in conjunction with his friend EOS	14.783716
SOS i cannot believe it EOS	17.536274
SOS why should they try to influence him EOS	16.033986
SOS they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it EOS	20.495822
SOS your first position is false EOS	15.116626
SOS they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride EOS	15.528635
SOS beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing EOS	24.849933
SOS they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better EOS	19.732115
SOS but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s EOS	19.197277
SOS what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable EOS	20.116033
SOS if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed EOS	22.531903
SOS by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy EOS	14.513195
SOS do not distress me by the idea EOS	27.523194

SOS let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood EOS	25.808633
SOS elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time TITLE bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them EOS	16.763701
SOS TITLE bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity EOS	17.499774
SOS her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day EOS	17.567063
SOS TITLE bennet s best comfort was that TITLE bingley must be down again in the summer EOS	19.580755

SOS he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably EOS	11.854084
SOS thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me EOS	21.436952

SOS true said TITLE bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it EOS	20.532938
SOS TITLE wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family EOS	11.663213
SOS they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve EOS	22.523121
SOS the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on TITLE darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked TITLE darcy before they had known any thing of the matter EOS	17.649521
SOS miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else TITLE darcy was condemned as the worst of men EOS	11.851303
SOS after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity TITLE collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday EOS	16.291984
SOS the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men EOS	17.520070
SOS he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks EOS	16.346764
SOS on the following monday TITLE bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn EOS	17.039530

SOS when this was done she had a less active part to play EOS	26.086456
SOS it became her turn to listen EOS	20.258372
SOS TITLE bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of EOS	14.264265

SOS he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him EOS	26.235607
SOS the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever EOS	21.365751
SOS the lucases are very artful people indeed sister EOS	14.885211
SOS they are all for what they can get EOS	33.934625
SOS i am sorry to say it of them but so it is EOS	22.797359

SOS however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves EOS	18.132011
SOS TITLE gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation EOS	20.327475
SOS when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject EOS	20.320621
SOS it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she EOS	19.597683
SOS i am sorry it went off EOS	12.108321
SOS but these things happen so often EOS	19.689237
SOS a young man such as you describe TITLE bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent EOS	15.332877
SOS an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us EOS	21.215458
SOS we do not suffer by accident EOS	24.056881
SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	16.041274
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	13.587343
SOS it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment EOS	17.485264
SOS pray how violent was TITLE bingley s love EOS	19.789946
SOS i never saw a more promising inclination EOS	18.968087
SOS he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her EOS	10.888213

SOS at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer EOS	17.278211
SOS could there be finer symptoms EOS	18.919292
SOS is not general incivility the very essence of love EOS	19.179382

SOS of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt EOS	34.841680
SOS poor jane EOS	43.392040
SOS i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately EOS	19.697400
SOS it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner EOS	24.245135
SOS but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us EOS	19.885286
SOS change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything EOS	18.706533
SOS elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence EOS	16.436501
SOS i hope added TITLE gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her EOS	17.658507
SOS we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her EOS	17.789940
SOS and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and TITLE darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london EOS	23.877777
SOS my dear aunt how could you think of it EOS	17.915715
SOS TITLE darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it TITLE bingley never stirs without him EOS	12.959228
SOS so much the better EOS	22.434743
SOS i hope they will not meet at all EOS	20.404980

SOS she will not be able to help calling EOS	18.163533
SOS she will drop the acquaintance entirely EOS	20.124168
SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	17.028949
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	18.294295
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	19.852589
SOS the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement EOS	18.876331
SOS TITLE bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner EOS	17.410779
SOS when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers TITLE wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions TITLE gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both EOS	17.919137
SOS without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment EOS	19.444224
SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	17.333452
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	19.336875
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	17.987386
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	14.898848
SOS here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse EOS	18.398596
SOS in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself EOS	15.121132
SOS on being made acquainted with the present TITLE darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard TITLE fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy EOS	15.813083
SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	15.556929
SOS seriously i would have you be on your guard EOS	29.754392
SOS do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent EOS	18.975326
SOS i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better EOS	20.571164
SOS but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you EOS	20.660257
SOS you have sense and we all expect you to use it EOS	25.522974

SOS yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise EOS	21.801460
SOS well then you need not be under any alarm EOS	20.670147
SOS i will take care of myself and of TITLE wickham too EOS	21.297659

SOS i will try again EOS	17.811744
SOS at present i am not in love with TITLE wickham no i certainly am not EOS	25.279578
SOS but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not EOS	18.847539
SOS i see the imprudence of it EOS	20.538196
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS that abominable TITLE darcy EOS	21.746836
SOS my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it EOS	16.082227
SOS my father however is partial to TITLE wickham EOS	16.688320
SOS in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist EOS	15.810458
SOS all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry EOS	23.477441
SOS i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object EOS	17.502875
SOS when i am in company with him i will not be wishing EOS	22.175995
SOS in short i will do my best EOS	32.913961
SOS perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often EOS	22.240090
SOS at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him EOS	15.883680
SOS as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that EOS	21.601379
SOS but do not imagine that he is always here so often EOS	21.444009
SOS it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week EOS	17.983943
SOS you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends EOS	20.294363
SOS but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied EOS	23.257032
SOS her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented EOS	15.800729
SOS TITLE collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to TITLE bennet EOS	18.786402
SOS his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy EOS	18.412131
SOS thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room EOS	14.067141
SOS as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza EOS	19.178874
SOS that you certainly shall EOS	43.058052
SOS and i have another favour to ask EOS	20.652044

SOS my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party EOS	19.634593
SOS indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them EOS	21.647685
SOS the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual EOS	16.585871
SOS elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible EOS	19.204761
SOS elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was EOS	20.401019
SOS charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen EOS	18.927809
SOS she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise EOS	11.874168
SOS the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging EOS	15.447702
SOS it was TITLE collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest EOS	19.002931
SOS jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys EOS	17.110032
SOS her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is EOS	19.085983
SOS jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline EOS	17.184563
SOS she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost EOS	22.274897
SOS my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street EOS	16.052900
SOS she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley EOS	20.386406

SOS i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her EOS	19.712575
SOS i enquired after their brother of course EOS	22.163240

SOS four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him EOS	24.211382
SOS she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention EOS	16.041071
SOS after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer EOS	16.643803
SOS the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt EOS	23.217874
SOS my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me EOS	14.078433
SOS but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion EOS	16.210267
SOS i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again EOS	17.931103
SOS caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time EOS	20.545533
SOS when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer EOS	18.231575
SOS i pity though i cannot help blaming her EOS	16.784759
SOS she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side EOS	15.253108
SOS but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it EOS	17.318838
SOS i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable EOS	17.712745
SOS i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago EOS	17.200814
SOS he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy EOS	19.886902
SOS i cannot understand it EOS	16.433827
SOS if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this EOS	15.536285

SOS from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on TITLE collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed EOS	14.779378
SOS as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was EOS	20.033805

SOS sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with EOS	18.983617
SOS while sir william was with them TITLE collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road EOS	16.307105
SOS the room in which the ladies sat was backwards EOS	21.339746
SOS elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for TITLE collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement EOS	18.326791
SOS from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to TITLE collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day EOS	15.478107
SOS she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out EOS	15.646575
SOS very few days passed in which TITLE collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours EOS	19.769132
SOS now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits EOS	19.175010
SOS she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that TITLE collins s joints of meat were too large for her family EOS	12.872776
SOS elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by TITLE collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty EOS	12.873550
SOS the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first EOS	15.404738
SOS their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach EOS	18.954625
SOS this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors EOS	19.560366
SOS her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity EOS	13.959843
SOS in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away EOS	22.636271
SOS easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important EOS	20.889874
SOS elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that TITLE darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself EOS	16.616978
SOS his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for TITLE collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence EOS	17.069280
SOS on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects EOS	13.173559
SOS there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for TITLE darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when TITLE collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him EOS	16.645415
SOS charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility EOS	15.699861
SOS TITLE darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me EOS	16.548124
SOS elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room EOS	12.674458
SOS colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman EOS	13.379463
SOS TITLE darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to TITLE collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure EOS	16.069288
SOS elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word EOS	15.335665
SOS colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to TITLE collins sat for some time without speaking to any body EOS	14.841413
SOS at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family EOS	17.921629
SOS she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months EOS	17.143412
SOS have you never happened to see her there EOS	28.506570
SOS she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet EOS	17.753811
SOS the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away EOS	15.798411
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings EOS	18.183233
SOS it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening EOS	16.158150
SOS for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter EOS	22.878565
SOS colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but TITLE darcy they had only seen at church EOS	20.116339
SOS the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room EOS	15.228000
SOS her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room EOS	15.751891
SOS colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and TITLE collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much EOS	15.812832
SOS he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of TITLE darcy EOS	14.383515
SOS his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam EOS	19.302285

SOS she practises very constantly EOS	15.911011
SOS so much the better EOS	22.434743
SOS it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account EOS	24.050407
SOS i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice EOS	13.463603
SOS i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though TITLE collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in TITLE jenkinson s room EOS	16.522457
SOS she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house EOS	19.695205
SOS TITLE darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer EOS	14.750403
SOS when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument EOS	19.085864
SOS he drew a chair near her EOS	17.719931
SOS lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance EOS	15.362495
SOS elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me TITLE darcy by coming in all this state to hear me EOS	18.030360
SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	16.264375
SOS there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others EOS	20.236394
SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	11.825415
SOS i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own EOS	17.175758
SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	20.425468
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	16.796516
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	17.357919
SOS i am not afraid of you said he smilingly EOS	17.940498
SOS pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam EOS	17.086739
SOS i should like to know how he behaves among strangers EOS	13.167107
SOS you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful EOS	14.388971
SOS the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did EOS	24.231367
SOS he danced only four dances EOS	14.423935
SOS i am sorry to pain you but so it was EOS	17.917821
SOS he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner EOS	15.565635
SOS TITLE darcy you cannot deny the fact EOS	17.833832
SOS i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party EOS	20.850730

SOS well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next EOS	23.083600
SOS my fingers wait your orders EOS	14.761601
SOS perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers EOS	14.645262
SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	21.030121
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	16.310585
SOS shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers EOS	14.865886
SOS i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him EOS	12.075622
SOS it is because he will not give himself the trouble EOS	23.001004
SOS i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before EOS	14.816638
SOS i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done EOS	15.168128

SOS they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression EOS	18.984760
SOS but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising EOS	20.131759
SOS it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution EOS	14.293938
SOS darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right EOS	28.348431

SOS here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of EOS	19.140913
SOS elizabeth immediately began playing again EOS	15.074092
SOS lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master EOS	19.065857
SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	16.844119
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	18.962352
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	15.724022
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	11.178679
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	20.755160
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	17.248284
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	15.970434
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	16.546819
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	13.725611
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	14.997433
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	20.748783
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	27.184883
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	29.004739
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	19.357544
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	21.041037
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	19.519239
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	20.474174
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	22.832852
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	17.444560
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	14.610692
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	18.924876
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	18.123842
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	18.692969
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	17.443620
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	19.598566
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	19.375417
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	18.606437
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	20.151397
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	18.709880
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	23.540075
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	15.705483

SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	24.823863
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	23.490206
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	17.381667
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	16.837960
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	18.470695
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	23.672577
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	20.628570
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	20.625170
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	13.583589
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	26.108882
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	16.831518
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	18.825919
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	22.615543
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	28.579850
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	13.988667
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	13.946950
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	9.995385

SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	24.943141
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	18.603136
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	20.087190
SOS all field sports were over EOS	12.719459
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	18.470332
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	17.341122
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	17.223990
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	24.932514
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	15.903014
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	17.427045
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	19.837104
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	18.214325
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	17.902593
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	19.924825
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	16.308766
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	17.112272
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	15.064224
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	15.430102
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	18.194945
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	14.095920
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	19.104013
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	29.672152
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	14.355179
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	16.992752
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	19.147699
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	28.178522
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	21.418021
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	21.021722
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	14.892737
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	20.258442
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	16.273616
SOS are you going much farther EOS	26.248160
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	25.904849
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	21.646586
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	19.072968
SOS said she EOS	44.177165
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	17.694845
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	16.495252
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	18.637135
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	22.446566
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	15.137272
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	20.114330
SOS but so we all do EOS	27.523094
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	18.309242
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	20.173617
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	14.887856
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	19.337655
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	16.158368
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	18.295853
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	17.626654
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	15.958054
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	19.160700
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	22.344232
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	14.982993
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	24.420989
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	16.017632
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	15.590139
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	22.995401
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	16.304519
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	13.311066
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	20.616816
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	20.193543
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	16.342898
SOS are you indeed EOS	39.364042
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	20.259579
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	23.721248
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	19.173474
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	17.196807
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	20.662521
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	14.909602
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	17.272242
SOS i think i have heard you say that you know them EOS	21.242908
SOS i know them a little EOS	28.322222
SOS their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy s EOS	22.232645
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	14.171459
SOS care of him EOS	38.737008
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	15.481560
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	23.055803
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	20.478586
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	20.633315
SOS what is it you mean EOS	29.362327
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	21.554512
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	13.686510
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	26.090808
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	18.199348
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	24.769156
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	19.037725
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	17.561377
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	19.792868
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	24.060747
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	13.956499
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	20.941558
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	19.161072
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	22.091339
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	31.294433
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	15.554138
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	16.949410
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	17.980795
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	19.045640
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	14.491591
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	15.840815
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	19.574386
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	18.738587
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	16.838533
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	14.692654
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	18.657474
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	17.922289
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	14.345137
SOS to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection EOS	22.982963
SOS all loveliness and goodness as she is EOS	22.087521
SOS her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating EOS	20.639373
SOS neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which TITLE darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach EOS	14.668019
SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	16.298439
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	16.730887
SOS TITLE collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but TITLE collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home EOS	15.737883
SOS when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against TITLE darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent EOS	18.248678
SOS they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering EOS	10.197573
SOS but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded EOS	16.723214
SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	17.674848
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	12.612804
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	20.745236
SOS she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him EOS	18.450511
SOS while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her EOS	16.185237
SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	18.029456
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	18.171644
SOS she answered him with cold civility EOS	22.641359
SOS he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room EOS	14.495552
SOS elizabeth was surprised but said not a word EOS	19.150254
SOS after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled EOS	18.174619
SOS it will not do EOS	23.518529
SOS my feelings will not be repressed EOS	27.683496
SOS you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you EOS	15.397364
SOS elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression EOS	16.833522
SOS she stared coloured doubted and was silent EOS	17.161993
SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	22.295612
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	18.412394
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	15.477489
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	15.242224
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	19.522571
SOS he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand EOS	17.998684
SOS as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer EOS	24.118374
SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	16.346795
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	15.859461
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	19.109934
SOS but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly EOS	17.605807
SOS i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one EOS	16.928674
SOS it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration EOS	17.860077
SOS the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation EOS	16.133232
SOS TITLE darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise EOS	13.908288
SOS his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature EOS	16.204593
SOS he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it EOS	17.102464
SOS the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful EOS	29.937765
SOS at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting EOS	20.687367
SOS i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected EOS	17.452750
SOS but it is of small importance EOS	17.085026
SOS i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character EOS	14.061491
SOS was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil EOS	22.207110
SOS but i have other provocations EOS	16.419007
SOS you know i have EOS	33.251811
SOS had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister EOS	16.757085
SOS as she pronounced these words TITLE darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued EOS	17.008671
SOS i have every reason in the world to think ill of you EOS	21.027172
SOS no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there EOS	11.352280
SOS you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind EOS	15.288905
SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	14.264890
SOS he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity EOS	19.056949
SOS can you deny that you have done it EOS	23.674417
SOS she repeated EOS	54.914366
SOS with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success EOS	19.792089
SOS towards him i have been kinder than towards myself EOS	21.205415
SOS elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her EOS	11.685743
SOS but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded EOS	15.822655
SOS long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided EOS	27.847254
SOS your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from TITLE wickham EOS	18.985325
SOS on this subject what can you have to say EOS	24.286118
SOS in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself EOS	14.144811
SOS or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others EOS	13.236669
SOS you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour EOS	18.798189
SOS who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him EOS	16.843920
SOS his misfortunes EOS	46.982109
SOS repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed EOS	14.378633
SOS and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy EOS	21.266612
SOS you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty EOS	15.382515
SOS you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him EOS	16.606716
SOS you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert EOS	19.705412
SOS you have done all this EOS	23.397079
SOS and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule EOS	16.580764
SOS and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me EOS	18.794178
SOS this is the estimation in which you hold me EOS	21.480699
SOS i thank you for explaining it so fully EOS	16.958086
SOS my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed EOS	11.785754
SOS but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design EOS	13.724122
SOS these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing EOS	9.138531
SOS but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence EOS	20.694847
SOS nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related EOS	29.614892
SOS they were natural and just EOS	26.795405
SOS could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections EOS	28.875210
SOS to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own EOS	16.727493
SOS elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken TITLE darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	19.035707
SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	20.510583
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	14.102435
SOS she went on EOS	31.778760
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	16.752300
SOS you have said quite enough madam EOS	21.727238
SOS i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been EOS	27.320613
SOS forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness EOS	20.642966
SOS and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house EOS	18.423730
SOS the tumult of her mind was now painfully great EOS	20.749626
SOS she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour EOS	13.965575
SOS her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it EOS	15.652497
SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	16.325649
SOS that he should have been in love with her for so many months EOS	19.037001
SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	20.767524
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	13.633942
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	14.414786
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	15.141910
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	14.287433
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	14.089535
SOS she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of TITLE darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road EOS	16.033719
SOS the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground EOS	16.580595
SOS after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park EOS	16.229986
SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	21.504263
SOS she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being TITLE darcy she was directly retreating EOS	14.499889
SOS but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name EOS	14.390526
SOS she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be TITLE darcy she moved again towards the gate EOS	18.953417
SOS he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you EOS	16.605529
SOS will you do me the honour of reading that letter EOS	27.377132
SOS and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight EOS	18.782495
SOS with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand EOS	13.700425
SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	14.556433
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	18.966884
SOS it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you EOS	12.990292
SOS i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read EOS	16.621852
SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	16.018224
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	15.142423
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	13.417470
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	14.792234
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	16.189931
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	20.654576
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	17.450469
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	16.990467
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	22.253565
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	23.301882
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	18.255324
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	26.499568
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	19.937888
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	23.214644
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	15.673274
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	21.141579
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	22.796101
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	17.243747
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	14.736393
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	13.644425
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	19.371908
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	18.360691
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	11.204406
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	18.230380
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	14.631945
SOS pardon me EOS	35.711592
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	22.191877
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	17.390600
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	16.296873
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	21.844916
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	30.922927
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	13.563667
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	17.689713
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	12.596926
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	15.627250
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	22.267969
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	17.145387
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	19.207631
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	16.746091
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	15.841327
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	15.690858
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	20.196143
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	18.310681
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	11.228979
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	26.457034
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	22.727971
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	15.385365
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	14.709540
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	15.079181
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	16.889399
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	14.947158
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	16.893785
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	22.824942
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	14.953089
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	22.795324
SOS but whatever may be the sentiments which TITLE wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character EOS	14.947772
SOS it adds even another motive EOS	16.394725
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	16.425077
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	11.384390
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	14.434339
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	14.837565
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	16.937414
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	20.097129
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	22.566705
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	17.469318
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	16.688672
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	17.377193
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	13.930632
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	24.048264
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	19.751435
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	16.580684
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	10.598255
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	22.111478
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	17.957901
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	25.171243
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	17.927298
SOS i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being EOS	17.684378
SOS having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy EOS	23.428310
SOS my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself EOS	16.772832
SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	15.967504
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	17.150091
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	14.810735
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	25.322383
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	18.822246
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	15.058350
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	18.367617
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	15.079210
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	21.558819
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	19.152178
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	19.170919
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	20.629822
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	14.702773
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	16.784972
SOS i will only add god bless you EOS	12.357489
SOS fitzwilliam darcy EOS	63.776251
SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	21.113836
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	17.000765
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	26.696763
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	19.268975
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	19.847789
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	16.238667
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	19.215037
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	14.854893
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	17.841077
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	11.926509
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	18.175645
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	12.274831
SOS this cannot be EOS	35.505781
SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	19.223141
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	17.096011
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	15.581982
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	19.610741
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	19.232358
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	18.913603
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	13.070655
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	16.143476
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	22.933385
SOS again she read on EOS	40.666668
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	15.542224
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	16.365969
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	16.115398
SOS of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself EOS	25.644340
SOS as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring EOS	22.101945
SOS his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue EOS	20.433633
SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	10.739412
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	15.358428
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	17.960243
SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	18.519667
SOS but alas EOS	22.734857
SOS the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question EOS	17.580120
SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	17.985965
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	22.510707
SOS many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory EOS	28.603168
SOS she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before EOS	16.612952
SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	17.918675
SOS she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing TITLE darcy that TITLE darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week EOS	16.237560
SOS she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking TITLE darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son EOS	16.013873
SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	20.800732
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	13.883370
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	17.509607
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	12.790977
SOS that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling EOS	19.367236
SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	16.494803
SOS she grew absolutely ashamed of herself EOS	16.989275

SOS from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that TITLE darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again EOS	21.838075
SOS widely different was the effect of a second perusal EOS	25.869868
SOS how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other EOS	18.494555

SOS when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe EOS	16.129286
SOS the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers EOS	17.716420
SOS the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt EOS	26.871180
SOS it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before EOS	15.954162
SOS after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation EOS	13.983536
SOS she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence TITLE darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found EOS	18.017547

SOS to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther EOS	16.969817
SOS it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where TITLE bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs EOS	14.901270

SOS she dared not relate the other half of TITLE darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend EOS	16.552915
SOS here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery EOS	14.299704

SOS she felt anew the justice of TITLE darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend EOS	16.007101
SOS but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from TITLE forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton EOS	17.350696
SOS this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married EOS	19.666802

SOS in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned EOS	19.932032
SOS as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go EOS	17.878200
SOS she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as TITLE forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home EOS	18.179575
SOS he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances EOS	19.223961

SOS we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton EOS	16.581041
SOS let her go then EOS	25.899155
SOS colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body EOS	18.673326
SOS at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here EOS	20.717371
SOS the officers will find women better worth their notice EOS	15.236317
SOS let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance EOS	19.409291
SOS at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life EOS	10.645047
SOS with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry EOS	22.470763
SOS it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them EOS	12.627996
SOS she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition EOS	13.777262
SOS had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility EOS	17.888278
SOS in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness EOS	13.067997

SOS she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once EOS	9.352484
SOS had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations EOS	16.871668
SOS they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same EOS	20.956609
SOS lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself EOS	18.695497

SOS elizabeth was now to see TITLE wickham for the last time EOS	26.240219
SOS having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so EOS	14.224777

SOS in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her EOS	15.053536
SOS she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal EOS	15.868618
SOS on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and TITLE darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former EOS	17.817382
SOS he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him EOS	16.868880

SOS in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was EOS	27.495125
SOS while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning EOS	15.445667
SOS there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood EOS	17.776132
SOS wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards TITLE darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right EOS	15.338678
SOS his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by EOS	19.640576
SOS i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe EOS	15.650667
SOS his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart EOS	18.766475
SOS elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head EOS	18.431201
SOS she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him EOS	18.773834
SOS the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again EOS	15.299591
SOS when the party broke up lydia returned with TITLE forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning EOS	15.238423
SOS the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic EOS	18.179941
SOS kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy EOS	16.393122
SOS TITLE bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard EOS	17.021133
SOS had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort EOS	16.705048
SOS her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her EOS	13.090098
SOS respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown EOS	15.383792
SOS but TITLE bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice EOS	15.738199
SOS he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments EOS	14.558224
SOS to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement EOS	18.125155
SOS this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given EOS	14.123302
SOS elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband EOS	23.219956
SOS she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible EOS	14.374269
SOS but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife EOS	11.712871
SOS when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment EOS	19.486482
SOS their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp EOS	13.362799
SOS upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself EOS	18.060113
SOS it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment EOS	15.816620

SOS when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short EOS	19.277576
SOS those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as TITLE forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public EOS	17.265533

SOS the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from TITLE gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent EOS	14.748827
SOS TITLE gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire EOS	14.431113

SOS but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered EOS	18.698770

SOS not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves EOS	18.309546

SOS elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her EOS	19.356373
SOS at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of TITLE darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her EOS	16.712325
SOS she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery EOS	17.055600

SOS every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression EOS	17.014141
SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	16.906025
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	15.510004
SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	13.301409
SOS their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush EOS	18.130609
SOS he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility EOS	14.748823
SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	16.291284
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	16.506569
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	15.882532
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	18.274689
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	18.691874
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	16.116927
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	18.194399
SOS she was overpowered by shame and vexation EOS	12.298228
SOS her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world EOS	20.419357
SOS how strange must it appear to him EOS	17.315897
SOS in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man EOS	15.102378

SOS why did she come EOS	32.714168
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	23.331368
SOS had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage EOS	16.073515

SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	16.169683
SOS that he should even speak to her was amazing EOS	22.982061
SOS but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family EOS	20.345762
SOS never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting EOS	22.674987
SOS what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand EOS	16.409600
SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	19.221987
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	16.522771
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	20.286532
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	18.773147
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	23.130079
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	26.932118
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	16.810448
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	12.225242
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	16.927039
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	21.107093
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	13.935741
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	12.806070
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	12.629734
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	16.350462
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	20.814909
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	20.065519
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	16.373614
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	15.114542
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	16.827898
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	15.996218
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	24.603327
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	18.420874
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	16.213164
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	24.672871
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	14.882116
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	17.131680
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	13.820280
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	20.820933
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	19.050369
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	16.530562
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	14.781767
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	16.202139
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	21.739454
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	16.252641

SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	13.531326
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	15.685533
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	19.818519
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	18.817301
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	17.062913
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	18.714960
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	16.027720
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	20.513410
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	19.142115
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	19.096009
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	20.607268
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	21.239654
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	18.994580
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	22.208404
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	26.390173
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	17.598880
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	20.469106
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	24.776191
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	15.793155
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	13.241718
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	14.921002
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	16.265354
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	14.933501
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	17.782359
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	12.596815
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	21.629151
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	18.420899
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	18.750731
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	19.642330
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	34.355709
SOS to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good EOS	21.141865
SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	23.454819
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	18.757635
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	20.057920
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	17.262984
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	19.694335
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	22.304563
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	20.029861
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	15.898724
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	18.759751
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	18.048159
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	13.483036
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	18.922739
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	17.341312
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	15.102839
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	15.281812
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	17.122743
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	20.024958
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	21.758661
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	16.421364
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	18.675252
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	13.045647
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	23.081453
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	19.481052
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	11.623909
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	13.035553
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	15.852439
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	18.363187
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	22.941505
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	20.453641
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	15.434495
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	14.630261
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	19.188030
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	14.556309
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	17.725484
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	18.118290
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	17.460058
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	18.816308
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	20.458910
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	13.546549
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	16.356332
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	16.673008
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	27.259318
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	17.057810
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	19.906398
SOS in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh EOS	17.408665
SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	22.248885
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	19.575395
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	18.892568
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	15.939568
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	20.550407
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	15.591010
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	23.002940
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	14.886447
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	15.793691
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	21.304559
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	13.745762
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	13.859326
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	15.845965
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	16.657940
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	15.375864
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	15.569816
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	15.438734
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	20.624383
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	17.808283
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	15.842897
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	15.897990
SOS it was evident that she was much better acquainted with TITLE darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her EOS	18.634288
SOS they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry EOS	22.360861
SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	22.247177
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	17.833377
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	16.377863
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	19.028218
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	19.185012
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	18.352522
SOS with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which TITLE darcy afterwards discharged EOS	15.781248
SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	18.464234
SOS she certainly did not hate him EOS	24.719611
SOS no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called EOS	18.888449
SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	15.799374
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	19.326710
SOS it was gratitude EOS	29.882235
SOS gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection EOS	14.416825
SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	12.217591
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	18.327723
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	19.286719
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	17.568305
SOS they were therefore to go EOS	23.814369
SOS elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply EOS	24.845697
SOS TITLE gardiner left them soon after breakfast EOS	19.054061
SOS the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon EOS	18.528242
SOS convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed EOS	19.502883
SOS on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer EOS	11.181122
SOS its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn EOS	11.266582
SOS in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with TITLE hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london EOS	20.746368
SOS georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved EOS	16.169707
SOS TITLE gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her EOS	15.601255
SOS by TITLE hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments EOS	15.526676
SOS it was first broken by TITLE annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and TITLE gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on EOS	13.623814
SOS miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard EOS	17.575873
SOS elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention EOS	15.616927
SOS this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much EOS	20.164880
SOS her own thoughts were employing her EOS	18.261947
SOS she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room EOS	17.762265
SOS she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine EOS	22.168577
SOS after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family EOS	16.198208
SOS she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more EOS	17.248264
SOS the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from TITLE annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post EOS	13.188866
SOS there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table EOS	11.957764
SOS while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of TITLE darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came EOS	18.012015
SOS he had been some time with TITLE gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning EOS	17.065970
SOS no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room EOS	16.570282
SOS in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to TITLE darcy were by no means over EOS	15.663239
SOS miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side EOS	17.015007
SOS miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton EOS	15.256928
SOS they must be a great loss to your family EOS	24.628307
SOS in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone EOS	13.230945
SOS while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes EOS	12.406439
SOS had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps EOS	14.900866
SOS not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement EOS	19.703071
SOS to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own EOS	17.457442
SOS he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend EOS	19.307703
SOS elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more EOS	12.624636
SOS her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully EOS	18.801225
SOS their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while TITLE darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress EOS	15.461552
SOS but georgiana would not join her EOS	27.033071
SOS her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable EOS	16.062842
SOS when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister EOS	19.347915

SOS her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them EOS	17.340878
SOS they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable EOS	14.697082
SOS persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected EOS	17.744395
SOS he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty EOS	16.560035

SOS her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace EOS	14.334586
SOS she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress EOS	13.088133

SOS but self though it would intrude could not engross her EOS	19.964758
SOS lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern EOS	14.711357

SOS as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination EOS	13.639498
SOS if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty EOS	15.226520
SOS but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment EOS	14.405337
SOS be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business EOS	16.720049

SOS while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible EOS	18.914607
SOS but now it was all too natural EOS	28.397623
SOS for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey EOS	14.480248
SOS she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body EOS	18.001702

SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	20.768919
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	16.445200
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	12.330038
SOS though lydia had never been a favourite with them TITLE and TITLE gardiner could not but be deeply affected EOS	21.558487
SOS not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror TITLE gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power EOS	17.702933

SOS and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth EOS	20.887349
SOS oh that i knew how it was EOS	26.428858
SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	16.723565
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	17.484575
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	18.373067
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	18.732906
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	15.297097
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	30.811005
SOS could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster EOS	18.349061

SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	19.156576

SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	16.278589
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	15.389827

SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	17.147310
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	14.416042

SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	13.280267
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	17.620506
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	20.827494
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	22.777079
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	24.121237
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	16.678867
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	22.886991
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	19.593073
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	18.118197

SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	15.858226
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	17.708160
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	20.499513
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	16.863064
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	24.957879
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	24.750974
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	20.958254

SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	18.852934
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	18.410697
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	16.917582
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	18.492336
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	30.801920

SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	24.174596
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	19.755543
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	20.538577
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	18.042886

SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	16.549521

SOS miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding EOS	18.924645
SOS TITLE hill began instantly to express her joy EOS	16.238955
SOS elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom EOS	16.739711
SOS poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful EOS	21.413767
SOS she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained EOS	16.232259
SOS TITLE bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him EOS	15.277577
SOS he now wished it more than ever EOS	23.493207
SOS had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her EOS	17.876851
SOS the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place EOS	13.156013
SOS he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could EOS	18.860903
SOS when first TITLE bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son EOS	19.399160
SOS this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for EOS	14.508832
SOS five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and TITLE bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would EOS	18.504104
SOS this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving EOS	21.738632
SOS TITLE bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income EOS	12.141228
SOS five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on TITLE bennet and the children EOS	17.075229
SOS but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents EOS	18.800987
SOS this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and TITLE bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him EOS	20.645677
SOS in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him EOS	14.408404
SOS he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement EOS	19.061559
SOS he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum EOS	15.715267
SOS that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible EOS	19.365550
SOS when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence EOS	13.924795
SOS his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution EOS	14.765738
SOS he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her EOS	19.568687
SOS the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood EOS	13.228175
SOS it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy EOS	15.600380
SOS to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house EOS	14.888056
SOS but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain EOS	18.393803
SOS it was a fortnight since TITLE bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high EOS	18.953994
SOS no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph EOS	18.757034
SOS the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants EOS	15.680489
SOS she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance EOS	13.527917
SOS haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off EOS	12.678251
SOS i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful EOS	14.501776
SOS her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained EOS	20.193264
SOS but when they had withdrawn he said to her TITLE bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding EOS	20.561463
SOS into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance EOS	21.772054
SOS i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn EOS	13.951881
SOS a long dispute followed this declaration but TITLE bennet was firm it soon led to another and TITLE bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter EOS	13.164309
SOS he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion EOS	19.915891
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly comprehend it EOS	15.375313
SOS that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible EOS	14.944039
SOS she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place EOS	16.605203
SOS elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make TITLE darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot EOS	19.632771
SOS she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means EOS	14.484763
SOS there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much EOS	15.724772
SOS not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them EOS	12.821116
SOS had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that TITLE darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned EOS	16.588144
SOS from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink EOS	23.556161
SOS the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this EOS	17.793384
SOS she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what EOS	19.686074
SOS she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it EOS	19.005966
SOS she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence EOS	19.344570
SOS she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet EOS	19.429667
SOS what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received EOS	16.401830
SOS he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex EOS	20.420416
SOS but while he was mortal there must be a triumph EOS	22.262247
SOS she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her EOS	16.203151
SOS his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes EOS	20.955444
SOS it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance EOS	16.792430
SOS but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was EOS	9.684865

SOS to TITLE bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again EOS	15.551460

SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	19.638891

SOS wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him EOS	23.583820
SOS she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion EOS	17.533343
SOS lydia was exceedingly fond of him EOS	22.979168
SOS he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him EOS	19.595844

SOS and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon EOS	21.004276
SOS however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham EOS	21.541251
SOS i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat EOS	17.712257
SOS well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them EOS	17.006367
SOS if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight EOS	16.430719

SOS and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it EOS	18.407308
SOS well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day EOS	23.397746
SOS but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out EOS	18.833505
SOS however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for TITLE darcy might have done as well EOS	16.797979

SOS he was to come there with wickham you know EOS	26.437050

SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	21.571604

SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	11.699432
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	18.829637
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	27.274786
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	17.746782
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	18.221036
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	17.727140
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	14.946856
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	19.778289
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	15.095165
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	12.876761
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	16.439547
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	16.104348
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	16.920498
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	18.686470
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	20.102397
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	17.845255
SOS gracechurch street sept EOS	15.769017
SOS NUM EOS	100.259386
SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	15.450982
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	17.125926
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	19.641303
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	12.891239
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	22.125142
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	14.577245
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	22.640316
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	20.775355
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	17.153735
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	18.921565
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	17.188927
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	16.101008
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	15.644592
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	27.958929
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	13.612869
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	16.213633
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	19.133023
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	17.896235
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	12.210965
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	20.878448
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	23.401472
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	14.959175
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	20.929137
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	12.892018
SOS they were in street EOS	21.887871
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	19.054729
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	17.774780
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	15.383909
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	19.612925
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	20.386989
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	19.695956
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	15.185568
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	16.045198
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	21.587532
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	20.460522
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	20.780291
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	16.049178
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	18.291812
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	21.786836
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	22.055717
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	19.207359
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	16.894908
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	17.123917
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	20.841925
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	26.830872
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	20.907352
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	22.067307
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	15.779764
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	24.624241
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	17.687200
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	14.740442
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	19.335658
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	19.237347
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	15.017449
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	17.909722
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	24.606183
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	14.685058
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	22.574632
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	16.126245
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	18.777967
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	17.253559
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	19.505491
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	18.757283
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	19.445869
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	22.139881
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	21.400281
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	21.650178
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	20.003325
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	17.088478
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	17.249630
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	19.865663
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	20.317178

SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	14.737851
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	14.909943

SOS elizabeth did not know what to make of it EOS	21.491140
SOS had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it EOS	19.284394
SOS yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation EOS	16.077563
SOS i will leave him to himself EOS	26.328345
SOS in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it EOS	19.787317

SOS consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see TITLE bingley in consequence of it before they did EOS	21.003846
SOS as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister EOS	21.613879

SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	27.707667
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	17.814013
SOS she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before EOS	14.220249
SOS but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house EOS	14.411351

SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	26.503285
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	17.059016
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	24.059970
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	23.355135
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	15.681343
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	18.049739
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	16.362374
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	15.545844
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	24.217205
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	17.893832
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	14.646776
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	13.898040
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	13.714270
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	19.312354
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	17.250940
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	18.457188
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	17.993883
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	18.009506
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	19.631585
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	16.858963
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	14.705429
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	17.038525
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	26.086905
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	30.263457
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	14.071718
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	15.961436
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	19.592452
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	34.186915
SOS said she EOS	44.177165
SOS yet why did he come EOS	30.174174

SOS bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations EOS	28.905634

SOS thank heaven EOS	24.190479
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	22.222233
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	18.494813
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	18.711501
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	21.973058
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	17.583027

SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	17.464519
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	16.493392
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	22.886899
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	15.226342
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	22.582592
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	14.301719
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	25.547304
SOS he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty EOS	18.989795
SOS jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever EOS	26.206166

SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	20.174493
SOS they then went away EOS	19.688872
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	15.134679
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	12.543448

SOS they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and TITLE bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived EOS	16.965483
SOS on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time EOS	17.337385
SOS when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister EOS	18.045299

SOS elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend EOS	13.210506
SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	16.709192
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	18.127264
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	15.305233
SOS it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour EOS	21.751576
SOS TITLE darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them EOS	17.737449
SOS he was on one side of her mother EOS	20.765187
SOS she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage EOS	18.733964
SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	17.070179
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	16.508051
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	15.849506
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	14.587563

SOS if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever EOS	23.082655
SOS the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas EOS	17.734908
SOS the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair EOS	13.958304
SOS and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined EOS	17.485017
SOS we want none of them do we EOS	27.732131
SOS darcy had walked away to another part of the room EOS	21.993426

SOS there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings EOS	13.628242
SOS she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still EOS	15.445611

SOS he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away EOS	21.836550
SOS when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party EOS	13.695995
SOS she now lost every expectation of pleasure EOS	21.476345
SOS they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself EOS	18.662479
SOS TITLE bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them EOS	13.723080

SOS she did indeed EOS	28.655282
SOS i do think TITLE long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously EOS	17.862217
SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	21.012452
SOS it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth EOS	21.594749
SOS the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other EOS	16.556527

SOS i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection EOS	16.880092
SOS it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man EOS	13.937593
SOS you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment EOS	19.366910
SOS how hard it is in some cases to be believed EOS	29.647102
SOS and how impossible in others EOS	25.407101
SOS but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge EOS	21.231983

SOS jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it EOS	18.138698
SOS in a few minutes TITLE bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you EOS	15.821329
SOS elizabeth was forced to go EOS	16.876899

SOS TITLE bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual EOS	15.482782
SOS bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter EOS	17.670162
SOS his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter EOS	17.982019
SOS he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and TITLE bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband EOS	15.408970

SOS bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and TITLE bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on EOS	22.341464
SOS the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected EOS	20.257780
SOS there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him EOS	14.001648
SOS bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening TITLE bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter EOS	21.053830
SOS elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes EOS	16.638843
SOS but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her EOS	19.141353
SOS on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all EOS	15.388704
SOS their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse EOS	24.345038
SOS not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room EOS	16.147470
SOS jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world EOS	14.100957

SOS she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty EOS	17.209870

SOS he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister EOS	20.110806
SOS elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship EOS	16.851052
SOS they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself EOS	17.071378
SOS it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever EOS	15.272682
SOS kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon EOS	14.658192
SOS TITLE bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when TITLE bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was EOS	14.343669
SOS not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you EOS	18.509444

SOS mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter EOS	16.705372
SOS bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept EOS	14.321376
SOS elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur EOS	18.920201
SOS in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief EOS	21.764681
SOS he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring EOS	17.498574

SOS he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty EOS	27.272267
SOS this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities EOS	17.786938
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him EOS	15.748178

SOS one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn EOS	18.570471

SOS she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word EOS	15.409775
SOS elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made EOS	18.166070
SOS TITLE bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness EOS	13.367854
SOS after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet EOS	19.258566
SOS that lady i suppose is your mother EOS	32.601701

SOS it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s EOS	13.939121
SOS this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west EOS	14.611596
SOS TITLE bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left TITLE and TITLE collins well EOS	16.804781
SOS yes very well EOS	22.649946
SOS i saw them the night before last EOS	22.310745
SOS elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling EOS	26.010396
SOS but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled EOS	18.718236
SOS TITLE bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn EOS	14.188579

SOS how could i ever think her like her nephew EOS	21.953164
SOS said she as she looked in her face EOS	37.727260

SOS though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you EOS	18.994327
SOS if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far EOS	17.224630

SOS at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted EOS	13.038079

SOS has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage EOS	19.753755
SOS your ladyship has declared it to be impossible EOS	21.648497
SOS it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason EOS	20.062989

SOS from their infancy they have been intended for each other EOS	17.140957

SOS if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh EOS	19.116314
SOS you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage EOS	18.578193
SOS its completion depended on others EOS	14.215333
SOS if TITLE darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice EOS	18.343750

SOS your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us EOS	19.969302
SOS these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth EOS	15.628327
SOS but the wife of TITLE darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine EOS	18.443151

SOS i am ashamed of you EOS	18.492709

SOS your ladyship wants TITLE darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable EOS	19.779347
SOS supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin EOS	21.240097
SOS allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged EOS	19.082736
SOS you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these EOS	17.155741
SOS how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine EOS	17.658291

SOS you refuse then to oblige me EOS	17.279735

SOS neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance EOS	18.931084
SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	17.775970
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	22.151941
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	27.623540
SOS this is your final resolve EOS	14.363790

SOS i came to try you EOS	25.156080
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	16.176026

SOS i send no compliments to your mother EOS	19.698412
SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	25.490333

SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	14.482486
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	17.856172
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	19.488434
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	22.011177
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	17.895108
SOS and her calling here was prodigiously civil EOS	19.289024
SOS for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well EOS	22.089052
SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	18.697810
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	25.127476
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	16.199746
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	16.302394
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	13.213569
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	19.304198
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	20.483644
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	17.348332
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	14.023673
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	15.677281
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	20.115371
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	18.283621
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	13.131121
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	14.135419
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	29.093330
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	22.117865
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	16.556323
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	15.984802
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	14.060624
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	16.266672
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	23.794136
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	26.778701
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	19.619484
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	16.256769
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	22.697194
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	20.042929
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	16.753790
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	18.855270
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	21.818060
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	19.201453
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	15.521304
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	25.096348
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	29.324980
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	27.420361
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	33.666087
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	17.235054
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	15.371262
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	19.924297
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	16.646541
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	16.758431
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	17.789257
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	10.160124
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	15.744607
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	23.521919
SOS but now it comes out EOS	19.085756
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	17.582373
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	18.990223
SOS mr EOS	84.884630
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	42.590930
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	33.254554
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	14.957019
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	18.932941
SOS it is admirable EOS	24.799890
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	12.807243

SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS yes EOS	30.886272
SOS pray read on EOS	29.740627
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	17.407923
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	19.226375
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	16.199991
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	12.278263
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	14.571389
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	18.545293
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	15.305087
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	19.649386
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	20.171250
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	15.087936

SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	17.999505
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	20.055249
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	16.903914
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	17.736501
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	21.523999
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	22.192099
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	21.520951
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	18.740057
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	16.739648
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	20.151876
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	18.348542
SOS it was agreed to EOS	22.894588
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	14.015806
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	16.395117
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	16.076152
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	18.932879
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	16.721495
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	19.186378
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	16.115547
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	20.325140
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	22.861986
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	17.413529
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	22.771953
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	21.348498
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	20.843487
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	16.257039
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	22.476834
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	21.130017
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	19.993276
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	27.368550
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	18.114746
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	13.545615
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	18.431062
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	16.629407
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	16.808569
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	19.611822
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	18.033966
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	22.083064
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	24.660476
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	16.337063
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	17.949874
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	26.647329
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	16.755070
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	22.115875
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	20.122880
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	28.651365
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	12.407475
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	24.415920
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	21.449578
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	17.820301
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	14.332213
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	13.714514
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	18.009375
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	16.949005
SOS those were your words EOS	31.048965
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	17.608187
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	17.436213
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	17.582042
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	15.535631
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	15.834143
SOS the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me EOS	21.834911
SOS oh EOS	13.014971
SOS do not repeat what i then said EOS	27.748428
SOS these recollections will not do at all EOS	25.027823
SOS i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it EOS	16.228862
SOS darcy mentioned his letter EOS	34.137587
SOS did it said he did it soon make you think better of me EOS	29.047898
SOS did you on reading it give any credit to its contents EOS	20.508355
SOS she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed EOS	21.265163
SOS i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary EOS	22.057863
SOS i hope you have destroyed the letter EOS	17.135402
SOS there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again EOS	18.024699
SOS i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me EOS	13.009969
SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	16.754112
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	16.173958
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	21.035056
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	13.358645
SOS but think no more of the letter EOS	26.917590
SOS the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten EOS	17.617426
SOS you must learn some of my philosophy EOS	26.059306
SOS think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure EOS	17.669704
SOS i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind EOS	21.680060
SOS your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance EOS	16.220845
SOS but with me it is not so EOS	30.919095
SOS painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled EOS	14.883946
SOS i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle EOS	16.160684
SOS as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper EOS	18.968236
SOS i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit EOS	15.281232
SOS unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own EOS	13.452599
SOS such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth EOS	20.192434
SOS what do i not owe you EOS	19.885422
SOS you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous EOS	14.386178
SOS by you i was properly humbled EOS	36.992396
SOS i came to you without a doubt of my reception EOS	27.843922
SOS you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased EOS	16.250155

SOS hate you EOS	56.732179
SOS i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction EOS	18.050067
SOS i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley EOS	19.374661
SOS you blamed me for coming EOS	26.048938
SOS no indeed i felt nothing but surprise EOS	31.330154
SOS your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you EOS	19.238838
SOS my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due EOS	18.369071
SOS my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to EOS	17.156784
SOS how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you EOS	17.857962
SOS he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend EOS	17.212723
SOS she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther EOS	20.246663
SOS after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home EOS	14.924544
SOS what could become of TITLE bingley and jane EOS	21.266212
SOS was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs EOS	21.337033

SOS i must ask whether you were surprised EOS	23.972923

SOS i guessed as much EOS	22.881923
SOS and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case EOS	20.628956
SOS on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago EOS	19.811267
SOS i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent EOS	17.470957
SOS his surprise was great EOS	36.028281
SOS he had never had the slightest suspicion EOS	19.766679
SOS i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together EOS	19.421290
SOS elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend EOS	14.133846
SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	21.879419
SOS from the former EOS	41.346869
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	21.357058
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	20.092666
SOS it did EOS	41.351181
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	17.358674
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	14.895482
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	19.231441
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	18.397789
SOS he was angry EOS	29.764999
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	17.427601
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	13.383563
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	15.034497
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	16.940337
SOS in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house EOS	19.740391
SOS in the hall they parted EOS	23.937460
SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	17.135042
SOS was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table EOS	20.770847
SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	21.113158
SOS she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth EOS	15.736266
SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	13.844067
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	10.601576
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	15.965000
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	22.612272
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	23.402926

SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	31.474384
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	30.594349

SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	28.575754

SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	15.329907
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	15.089507

SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	15.275253
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	20.312099
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	19.044272
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	17.758503
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	16.373807

SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	18.842398
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	15.915280

SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	20.553398

SOS i shall go distracted EOS	13.809193
SOS this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away EOS	18.220126

SOS but my dearest love tell me what dish TITLE darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow EOS	20.352621
SOS this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for EOS	21.877178
SOS but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for TITLE bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion EOS	17.672899
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and TITLE bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem EOS	16.593395

SOS it is too long ago EOS	18.086645
SOS i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun EOS	21.016275
SOS my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not EOS	19.932741
SOS now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence EOS	25.549686
SOS for the liveliness of your mind i did EOS	30.258330
SOS you may as well call it impertinence at once EOS	17.587499
SOS it was very little less EOS	23.684186
SOS the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention EOS	14.544954
SOS you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone EOS	17.764402
SOS i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them EOS	16.662947
SOS had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you EOS	15.332251
SOS there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable EOS	18.884021
SOS to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love EOS	17.646001

SOS my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last EOS	15.535688
SOS what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here EOS	18.889140
SOS why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me EOS	20.012295
SOS because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement EOS	25.226092

SOS you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner EOS	31.377333

SOS my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect EOS	19.991897
SOS too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject EOS	16.453040

SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	26.174629
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	20.424937
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	25.746095
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	25.765702
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	22.154410
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	17.308998
SOS i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth EOS	15.754834
SOS but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly EOS	16.647762
SOS and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did EOS	18.609073
SOS but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected EOS	18.174953
SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	16.370765
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	22.048000
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	13.494075
SOS you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last EOS	19.499020
SOS i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes EOS	19.000884

SOS you are all to come to pemberley at christmas EOS	20.816836
SOS your s c EOS	18.311253
SOS TITLE darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what TITLE bennet sent to TITLE collins in reply to his last EOS	17.528105
SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	24.460624
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	21.109225

SOS he has more to give EOS	32.672670
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	18.994694
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	20.600280
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	17.759493
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	19.078659
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	15.817323
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	16.372321
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	18.491715
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	22.098669
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	15.464947
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	16.562599
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	14.214012
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	12.121902
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	12.506294
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	12.975318
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	15.629804
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	26.505631
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	18.969701
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	22.249641
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	18.486526
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	16.511925
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	12.430169
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	21.384165
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	18.985902
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	18.473651
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	14.223809
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	21.238968
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	19.681331
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	12.093198
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	20.060792
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	16.170415
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	17.303274
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	18.284074
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	15.896117
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	23.670129
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	20.330808
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	21.137260
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	21.839561
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	15.363757
SOS any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to TITLE darcy about it if you had rather not EOS	20.430395
SOS yours c EOS	29.008327
SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	19.628055
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	17.971343
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	13.676678
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	18.619999
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	15.396207
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	17.238793
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	21.017525
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	17.013647
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	12.552357
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	29.447840
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	21.564567
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	17.610803
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	15.258252
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	20.463493
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	19.455966
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	16.714384
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	16.007562
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	24.759796
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	17.027322
