SOS pray do not talk of that odious man EOS	9.082110

SOS jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail EOS	14.249138

SOS it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said TITLE bennet and nothing can clear TITLE collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn EOS	1.927671

SOS my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england EOS	1.708446
SOS as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch EOS	1.555532

SOS if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day EOS	1.733980

SOS she is a most charming young lady indeed EOS	16.199625
SOS lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth EOS	1.842044
SOS she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them EOS	1.771727

SOS i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her EOS	1.868656
SOS these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay EOS	2.071454
SOS you judge very properly said TITLE bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy EOS	1.418760
SOS may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study EOS	5.318157

SOS a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility EOS	1.540808

SOS when this information was given and they had all taken their seats TITLE collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when TITLE philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room EOS	1.376656

SOS TITLE wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker EOS	2.060271

SOS i dare say you will find him very agreeable EOS	64860.903792

SOS do not wish me such an evil EOS	39676.189387
SOS when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence EOS	138326.343233
SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	113348.875433
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	134642.198258
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	151364.536026
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	110285.214563
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	152020.247566
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	136855.687033
SOS very well EOS	1655.217987
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	154663.029910
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	127502.236350

SOS do you talk by rule then while you are dancing EOS	59396.896427
SOS sometimes EOS	26887.469613
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	88422.363167
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	152045.604319
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	104480.347114
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	152262.540887
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	153926.449592
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	116305.002188
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	101637.753678
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	64070.034028
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	57300.820222
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	140400.377132
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	147745.627901
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	141274.740497
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	140432.389769
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	128742.659465
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	124035.451004
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	49773.388753
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	131654.894722
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	56487.015847
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	94754.663982
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	108308.692512
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	131045.567943
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	151364.536026
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	163905.271465
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	88940.579633
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	162468.995234
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	179855.272349
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	23469.765306
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	109317.015631

SOS said he smiling EOS	11982.016387

SOS no EOS	773.172486

SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	120872.175345
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	46422.287972
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	154645.421019
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	38697.593402
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	137535.102845
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	159402.029247

SOS it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first EOS	159402.029247
SOS may i ask to what these questions tend EOS	126539.552532
SOS merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity EOS	179855.272349

SOS and what is your success EOS	34828.842970
SOS she shook her head EOS	141274.740497
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	31115.237333
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	162641.760671
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	157011.584536
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	96562.039906
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	119189.997386
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	175647.880288
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	110632.954509
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	143638.347622
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	144099.627721
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	114441.728904
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	149905.059324
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	151001.258170
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	175388.210446
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	64630.191617
SOS excuse my interference EOS	81537.087717
SOS it was kindly meant EOS	110970.070778

SOS said elizabeth to herself EOS	19050.119402
SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	79763.677173
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	133961.394035
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	126283.232650
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	156199.318647
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	173923.982504
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	124599.245773
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	140630.110515
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	118466.859155
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	143652.412551
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	99193.905782
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	31375.529131
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	99550.684334
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	162641.760671
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	27555.112243
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	95437.244744
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	139903.507727
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	71222.811836
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	158407.879200
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	132522.028400
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	152202.521790
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	150444.997464
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	127873.214872
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	173581.238590
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	71143.870030

SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	155297.241009
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	161161.072296
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	18930.331810
SOS indeed i am EOS	16116.239971
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	97678.143063
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	101680.675072
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	80588.198247
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	159765.820406
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	161714.863577
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	100435.206028
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	134549.082424
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	133176.199007
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	162844.826058
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	163905.271465
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	116614.794388
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	169807.483909
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	127386.995483
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	69766.050766
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	74787.821282
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	160310.117211
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	132999.452885
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	58262.079344
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	175094.382002
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	152527.533295
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	127377.814192
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	137690.416979
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	108371.868123
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	157941.023337
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	173489.273295
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	146054.622767
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	171695.157878
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	141553.955783

SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	103989.434489

SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	159402.029247
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	136685.202347
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	167526.066914
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	119031.582484
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	86795.186803
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	158737.104370
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	158663.186757
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	162267.916744
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	138554.708553
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	110970.070778
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	88749.442621
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	119332.384855
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	98382.088143

SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	147278.000956
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	115994.035899
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	159402.029247
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	100391.188543
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	158689.130116
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	120432.433465
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	143618.978152

SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	162548.795415
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	152652.989226
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	162468.995234
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	39581.310319
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	121177.228941
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	126442.106896
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	174876.038491
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	24783.086210
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	171376.568401

SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	171376.568401

SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	160806.080163
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	167642.372194

SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	125295.858925
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	179855.272349
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	143893.482785

SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	172520.854365
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	179855.272349

SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	55670.073599
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	173923.982504
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	157209.813974
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	131113.004701
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	160783.698602

SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	162123.888323
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	163044.225411
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	172643.614537

SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	141585.013748
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	159812.446798

SOS she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet EOS	135797.818335
SOS the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away EOS	131616.814164
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings EOS	112985.141980
SOS it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening EOS	162958.349503
SOS for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter EOS	100710.205128
SOS colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but TITLE darcy they had only seen at church EOS	112544.403311
SOS the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room EOS	170251.779873
SOS her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room EOS	151657.252652
SOS colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and TITLE collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much EOS	128406.260301
SOS he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of TITLE darcy EOS	167798.169207
SOS his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam EOS	175094.382002
SOS what is it you are talking of EOS	36511.311092
SOS what are you telling miss bennet EOS	87943.391105

SOS it is of all subjects my delight EOS	132999.452885

SOS how does georgiana get on darcy EOS	62315.584570
SOS TITLE darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency EOS	93133.077595
SOS i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal EOS	111858.499242
SOS i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice EOS	86803.519125
SOS she practises very constantly EOS	141274.740497
SOS so much the better EOS	2106.700773
SOS it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account EOS	119332.384855
SOS i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice EOS	141074.113437
SOS i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though TITLE collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the piano forte in TITLE jenkinson s room EOS	154113.003281
SOS she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house EOS	125927.390269
SOS TITLE darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer EOS	93827.232450
SOS when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument EOS	132395.272583
SOS he drew a chair near her EOS	151364.536026
SOS lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance EOS	153189.463890
SOS elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me TITLE darcy by coming in all this state to hear me EOS	160310.117211
SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	56566.153520
SOS there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others EOS	73193.304654
SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	161161.072296
SOS i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own EOS	144493.370502
SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	173757.422445
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	168493.439732
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	148289.505718
SOS i am not afraid of you said he smilingly EOS	37212.860725
SOS pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam EOS	123158.373200
SOS i should like to know how he behaves among strangers EOS	69304.469115
SOS you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful EOS	47509.692289
SOS the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did EOS	146413.624507
SOS he danced only four dances EOS	17838.555606
SOS i am sorry to pain you but so it was EOS	64794.802185
SOS he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner EOS	109615.975926
SOS TITLE darcy you cannot deny the fact EOS	67018.444721
SOS i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party EOS	100388.313752

SOS well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next EOS	157278.140184
SOS my fingers wait your orders EOS	86795.186803

SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	60927.501103
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	36180.653608
SOS shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers EOS	120450.450877
SOS i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him EOS	102123.420537
SOS it is because he will not give himself the trouble EOS	144409.951871
SOS i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before EOS	170658.456582
SOS i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done EOS	123127.965740

SOS they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression EOS	82696.498165
SOS but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising EOS	147443.202679
SOS it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution EOS	126695.319354
SOS darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right EOS	93134.915768
SOS you have employed your time much better EOS	30843.847050
SOS no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting EOS	83032.812995
SOS we neither of us perform to strangers EOS	154663.029910
SOS here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of EOS	134577.225359
SOS elizabeth immediately began playing again EOS	86795.186803
SOS lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master EOS	143665.068887
SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	130601.217115
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	179855.272349
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	157108.014509
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	118900.943494
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	157540.019547
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	156974.484153
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	161506.572736
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	153857.004901
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	106302.484049
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	152020.247566
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	119975.781870
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	163905.271465
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	179855.272349
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	158737.104370
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	127873.214872
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	126900.504810
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	147727.326589
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	151609.130564
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	111645.753021
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	7958.338822
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	135172.221212
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	68401.581115
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	97465.614198
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	137081.249118
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	147075.712426
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	145048.304212
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	171695.157878
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	169320.097399
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	110495.514519
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	96092.207542
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	120270.397988
SOS and what is fifty miles of good road EOS	60200.544953
SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	179855.272349
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	53579.871314
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	68197.371691
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	59909.812843
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	91539.393424
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	143469.932519
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	160467.180884
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	165947.337303
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	132052.435853
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	64752.898724
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	144304.049129
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	127585.142402
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	39839.294994
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	42611.949369
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	173394.572134
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	124450.868824
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	151364.536026
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	122818.691237
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	96170.794455
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	44298.095430
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	127402.318094
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	160942.253804
SOS all field sports were over EOS	68776.379019
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	179855.272349
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	123590.455459
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	174508.201045
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	133961.394035
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	174876.038491
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	147075.712426
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	141274.740497
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	134576.267155
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	168783.034425
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	168188.295483
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	138948.630669
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	167125.783698
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	131616.814164
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	149158.232374
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	147581.248131
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	154801.039034
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	96916.870426
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	60253.060709
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	174876.038491
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	165560.957942
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	151364.536026
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	59374.728667
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	169320.097399
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	170658.456582
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	152399.118175
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	136590.743207

SOS are you going much farther EOS	29419.003051
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	49285.691255

SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	74954.742080
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	163905.271465
SOS but so we all do EOS	86795.186803
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	106642.005652
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	60295.080119
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	87467.984634

SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	92508.966421
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	132395.272583
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	93267.122752

SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	179855.272349
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	145648.174595
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	151294.751479
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	52449.647778
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	150398.388226
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	150860.219023
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	124942.274515
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	150482.028979
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	122504.497851
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	143216.399678

SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	102530.692883
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	126830.442524
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	157990.576645

SOS it was all conjecture EOS	51886.761684
SOS what is it you mean EOS	21458.309916
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	144552.996144
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	8130.879197
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	165947.337303
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	169115.268193

SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	128762.627294
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	128535.936093

SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	113439.817601
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	152669.794288

SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	104107.125212
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	136742.445786

SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	145234.266291
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	88736.218176

SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	150945.887408
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	175388.210446

SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	170251.779873
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	96528.798808
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	151177.112082

SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	171990.676188
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	171376.568401

SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	170251.779873
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	152202.521790
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	175094.382002
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	154511.689638
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	139073.014470

SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	95917.797744
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	145866.194932
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	159402.029247

SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	171695.157878

SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	168328.260020

SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	171793.286952

SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	120302.565197

SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	174636.706577
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	171376.568401
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	151364.536026
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	157515.054639
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	118761.868359
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	168188.295483
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	113131.353228
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	129154.264622
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	87548.131616
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	108425.358569
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	113908.672384
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	155466.802750
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	93910.256734
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	147075.712426
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	66372.478850
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	136742.445786
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	119036.229899
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	130737.903816
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	160273.063474
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	149694.195744
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	152399.080903
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	134288.971919
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	165615.579573
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	126993.428829

SOS it adds even another motive EOS	147075.712426
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	176595.379314
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	25155.514764
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	176212.554354
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	142162.053199
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	147443.202679
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	105270.009462
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	151364.536026
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	172985.813036
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	87460.161240
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	127292.388208
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	173394.572134
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	152001.621448
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	139073.014470
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	160509.536775
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	77256.550293
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	172985.813036
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	66912.902717
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	39652.640684
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	163905.271465

SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	172386.340487
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	122804.112483
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	174636.706577
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	50657.918083
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	179855.272349
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	129231.116175
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	154663.029910
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	160783.698602
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	119668.095964
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	179855.272349
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	66460.497504
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	100479.084964
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	139324.267278
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	150670.586135

SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	172985.813036
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	171376.568401
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	161161.072296
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	152378.133019
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	106715.901735
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	159812.446798
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	174231.221727
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	169320.097399
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	74012.345689
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	162138.799004
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	179855.272349
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	122352.380327

SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	61287.938912
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	155955.963203
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	138924.026302
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	158689.130116
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	134053.089482
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	165080.739255
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	156138.550717
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	171990.676188
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	78267.666441
SOS again she read on EOS	95514.386640
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	175388.210446
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	173196.458969
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	128084.141748

SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	167216.997192
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	50261.088323

SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	114885.644613
SOS but alas EOS	120270.397988
SOS the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question EOS	161498.449714
SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	140683.251272
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	170658.456582

SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	134288.971919

SOS she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking TITLE darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son EOS	166517.937596
SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	101637.753678
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	174231.221727
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	139177.855381
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	169201.675687
SOS that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling EOS	174876.038491
SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	175094.382002

SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	169671.527987
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	179855.272349
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	169320.097399

SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	125943.632378
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	170658.456582
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	150273.002789
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	157278.140184
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	94473.871208
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	141608.283501
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	119675.566803
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	157278.140184
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	175196.527326
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	119858.102988
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	44190.051166
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	159402.029247
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	172985.813036
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	176086.088273
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	85063.954938

SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	158737.104370
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	97172.308416
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	104136.391603
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	145885.131702
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	134752.052729
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	133048.410186
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	175294.381879
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	60296.041089
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	120742.970088

SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	115633.634109
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	137226.307621
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	69361.927374
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	91333.883517
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	112492.283416

SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	125394.007122
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	125609.295929
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	148343.252918
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	75036.874382
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	107915.356146
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	132084.432578
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	97678.143063
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	157278.140184
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	154663.029910

SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	122352.380327
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	139834.712923
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	96656.326864
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	144725.466690
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	115983.561564
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	134197.839257
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	75209.658061
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	57620.819915
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	137081.249118
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	115114.815994
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	88169.267506
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	107848.657275
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	169400.789922
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	173923.982504
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	127998.214214
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	179855.272349
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	155149.327327
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	151075.229121
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	140013.910563
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	133187.328898
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	154687.566865
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	174508.201045
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	153088.510609
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	137231.021164
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	151884.786872
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	160783.698602
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	73287.579636
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	125580.450119
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	140477.315874
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	134385.422465
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	118549.989247
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	130790.330188
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	132472.566845
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	131686.083156
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	154527.104950
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	171990.676188
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	75353.441923
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	33868.256900
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	75411.941501
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	175196.527326
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	139963.353230
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	157278.140184
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	153675.828086
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	82217.836222

SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	119098.779873
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	161346.291692
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	138696.889599
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	94339.076465
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	118004.087974
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	143245.409458
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	175727.856020
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	103864.029804
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	122980.426811
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	105474.855846
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	161658.984913
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	143995.720152
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	168383.215483
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	136758.392529
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	97309.315903
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	90648.209657
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	168825.379717
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	149742.861079
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	175950.525562
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	179855.272349
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	86453.250476

SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	129196.283628
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	142891.708283
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	107036.749209
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	141532.484635

SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	176272.657557
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	170251.779873

SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	167416.845248
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	130721.260187
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	168494.752334
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	148634.076190

SOS while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of TITLE darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came EOS	161897.467031
SOS he had been some time with TITLE gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning EOS	132683.130486
SOS no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room EOS	153587.802747
SOS in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to TITLE darcy were by no means over EOS	175647.880288
SOS miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side EOS	136220.374657
SOS miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton EOS	126278.391791
SOS they must be a great loss to your family EOS	55934.301594
SOS in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone EOS	176019.504252
SOS while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes EOS	99545.290620
SOS had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps EOS	166305.238051
SOS not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement EOS	65506.317514

SOS he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend EOS	151421.297762
SOS elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more EOS	150419.038744
SOS her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully EOS	161665.260142
SOS their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while TITLE darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress EOS	152063.693336
SOS but georgiana would not join her EOS	151364.536026
SOS her brother s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable EOS	161234.896715
SOS when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister EOS	135552.379917

SOS her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them EOS	173394.572134
SOS they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable EOS	117152.499109
SOS persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected EOS	179855.272349
SOS he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty EOS	156825.821273

SOS elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere EOS	163249.176872
SOS elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill EOS	123993.601851

SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	143885.147097
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	146804.191142
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	131819.234190
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	153210.433552
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	54472.942353
SOS could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster EOS	86679.014745
SOS his temptation is not adequate to the risk EOS	157278.140184
SOS do you really think so EOS	23593.782385
SOS cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment EOS	40806.156964
SOS upon my word said TITLE gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion EOS	67376.913450
SOS it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it EOS	116162.688443
SOS i cannot think so very ill of wickham EOS	56860.175126
SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	68120.355796
SOS not perhaps of neglecting his own interest EOS	80583.552701
SOS but of every other neglect i can believe him capable EOS	107091.553000
SOS if indeed it should be so EOS	151364.536026
SOS but i dare not hope it EOS	58203.267927
SOS why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case EOS	75180.903855
SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	52290.667574
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	165947.337303
SOS and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road EOS	165947.337303
SOS well then supposing them to be in london EOS	54774.412469
SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	90193.395701
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	144857.301064
SOS but why all this secrecy EOS	78057.843188
SOS why any fear of detection EOS	64871.483366
SOS why must their marriage be private EOS	75044.847251
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS no no this is not likely EOS	34048.000877
SOS his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her EOS	169320.097399
SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	73030.933385
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	75025.713787
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	145943.462952
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	160783.698602
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	122970.235591
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	162882.403121
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	155466.802750
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	144099.760419
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	72536.268481
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	58297.881177
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	135345.646483
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	129233.046088
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	143646.636354
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	125860.546622
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	179855.272349
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	142888.964802
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	106612.949881
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	87460.161240
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	152020.247566
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	82072.934158
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	165947.337303
SOS that he has neither integrity nor honour EOS	80536.992235
SOS that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating EOS	105270.009462
SOS and do you really know all this EOS	33602.687863
SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	78585.210502
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	59412.817135
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	142491.297480
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	133829.706505
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	101686.063139
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	60253.060709
SOS he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her EOS	131517.392115
SOS but does lydia know nothing of this EOS	104136.391603
SOS can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand EOS	123158.373200
SOS oh yes EOS	4248.530429
SOS that that is the worst of all EOS	154663.029910
SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	130431.933279
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	133217.959523
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	175564.744137
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	152969.886433
SOS that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head EOS	134385.422465
SOS that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts EOS	168783.034425
SOS when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other EOS	97472.145701
SOS not the slightest EOS	36105.191030
SOS i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away EOS	137423.965765
SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	84654.030992
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	162948.953751
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	139404.797788
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	89490.886962
SOS fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness EOS	179855.272349
SOS they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day EOS	125716.191657
SOS it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations EOS	118055.999274
SOS the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome EOS	151760.775920
SOS elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her EOS	173196.458969
SOS elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives EOS	154687.566865
SOS not yet replied jane EOS	26435.405109
SOS but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well EOS	121909.441673
SOS is my father in town EOS	65535.023157
SOS yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word EOS	66776.516308
SOS and have you heard from him often EOS	70116.226628
SOS we have heard only once EOS	34637.709000
SOS he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do EOS	155466.802750
SOS he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention EOS	118331.096851
SOS and my mother how is she EOS	87943.391105
SOS how are you all EOS	21657.667959
SOS my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken EOS	119189.997386

SOS cried elizabeth EOS	970.095312
SOS you look pale EOS	22823.736034
SOS how much you must have gone through EOS	40557.222445
SOS her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while TITLE and TITLE gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party EOS	128250.841725
SOS jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears EOS	142888.964802
SOS when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give EOS	112249.122063
SOS the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage EOS	175647.880288
SOS TITLE bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing EOS	158079.740330
SOS if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her EOS	137787.382428
SOS why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight EOS	79492.372083
SOS i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after EOS	128516.812273
SOS i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am EOS	140357.023781
SOS poor dear child EOS	48768.675190
SOS and now here s TITLE bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all EOS	117406.496765
SOS the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do EOS	156199.318647
SOS they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and TITLE gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist TITLE bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia EOS	152097.116539
SOS do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain EOS	105891.255859
SOS it is not quite a week since they left brighton EOS	92136.334724
SOS in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost EOS	134921.664256
SOS as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done EOS	110642.151089
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS my dear brother replied TITLE bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for EOS	73769.957746
SOS and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry EOS	148343.252918
SOS and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married EOS	156889.186574
SOS and above all things keep TITLE bennet from fighting EOS	159402.029247
SOS tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day EOS	155651.341661

SOS i know you will contrive it all EOS	33152.007462
SOS but TITLE gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters EOS	156240.742249
SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	160156.391790
SOS in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before EOS	140196.633466
SOS one came from her books and the other from her toilette EOS	112033.817919
SOS the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty EOS	175388.210446
SOS as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of EOS	153157.271221
SOS but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation EOS	140357.023781
SOS then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex EOS	168070.836778
SOS elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply EOS	167526.066914
SOS mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them EOS	132659.281805
SOS in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy EOS	137734.401573
SOS after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard EOS	158041.811149

SOS i am so grieved for him EOS	74012.345689
SOS his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost EOS	101103.563957
SOS he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey EOS	145331.214306
SOS and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry EOS	159402.029247

SOS had colonel forster seen denny himself EOS	71851.434660
SOS yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it EOS	133808.502882
SOS he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before EOS	117483.303008
SOS and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married EOS	169807.483909

SOS i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did EOS	98159.276599

SOS and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false EOS	171695.157878
SOS oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened EOS	108051.865217

SOS wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him EOS	119400.642387
SOS she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion EOS	168684.129996
SOS lydia was exceedingly fond of him EOS	45316.945740
SOS he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him EOS	120098.681251

SOS well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss EOS	162641.760671
SOS i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted EOS	130796.667871
SOS and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon EOS	124296.775849
SOS however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham EOS	126970.784371
SOS i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat EOS	164996.090411
SOS well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them EOS	135467.022059
SOS if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight EOS	130988.275513
SOS not one party or scheme or any thing EOS	61985.683414
SOS to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open EOS	62121.568898
SOS well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man TITLE stone EOS	129703.204676
SOS and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it EOS	122455.441066
SOS well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day EOS	158737.104370
SOS but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out EOS	167526.066914

SOS i ought not to have said a word about it EOS	90655.159863

SOS what will wickham say EOS	57484.885198
SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	89550.056770
SOS if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject EOS	96131.492968
SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	11556.714586
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	137092.188818
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	124544.845490
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	90807.032300
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	122013.654319
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	81646.977230
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	161161.072296
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	179855.272349
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	137598.262325
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	135773.227592
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	125810.581126
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	154259.000368
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	107173.708444
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	160505.696913
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	72042.564143
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	152894.920130

SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	143389.966106
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	94513.611851
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	179855.272349
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	100575.021463
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	129768.459225
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	115912.103935
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	64482.943970
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	93133.077595
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	137265.332881
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	157540.019547
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	116600.456614
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	174508.201045
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	172521.845384
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	104136.391603
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	148722.562903
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	83821.778855
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	131747.821579
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	111905.486806
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	123826.503028
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	171990.676188
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	90858.758285
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	122975.731098
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	150645.710513
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	43898.350959
SOS they were in street EOS	10487.097999
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	159402.029247
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	174987.657385
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	80868.986945
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	169807.483909
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	116306.902818
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	156947.666446
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	174231.221727
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	121873.232994
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	141693.475075
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	102314.048911
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	148397.436976
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	126077.680011
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	150860.219023
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	55047.288767
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	129962.513062
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	131161.539184
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	132472.566845
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	130260.214979
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	113212.348102
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	35001.780550
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	110309.226478
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	71656.995201
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	103469.719506
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	151364.536026
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	165947.337303
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	95418.461826
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	156283.981393
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	125716.191657
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	161049.545014
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	119189.997386
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	71476.193941
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	127355.126383
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	144542.284356
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	167526.066914
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	140959.505923
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	128116.921483
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	143794.595988
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	74098.809375
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	135153.813785
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	114695.642559
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	152663.986375
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	156889.186574
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	136171.942058
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	130796.667871

SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	122573.775439
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	101735.374525
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	136052.643515
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	107088.310089
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	147075.712426
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	143300.476851
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	110362.759367

SOS gardiner EOS	4019.543118
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	172265.541468
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	167798.169207
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	163285.658537
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	115720.855805
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	118486.769918
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	143870.598559
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	179855.272349
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	99470.337353
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	74456.068445
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	63869.523689
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	123231.538699
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	163628.057885
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	161161.072296

SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	37964.689197
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	140031.596330

SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	67146.134150
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	151826.531613
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	106139.699775
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	179855.272349
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	145050.835520
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	154988.692615
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	155221.335545
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	163549.799925
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	27888.225938
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	91368.066447
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	159288.804044
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	122970.235591
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	124515.726702
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	149405.348664
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	137535.102845
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	83151.741040
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	96369.568203
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	80823.278101
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	137231.021164
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	144448.889972
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	173923.982504
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	141915.993015
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	128836.810973
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	107359.816953
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	148501.354196
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	147581.248131
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	84707.117539
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	90678.792267
SOS said she EOS	1394.407940

SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	109603.747066

SOS thank heaven EOS	4782.452108
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	105173.919750
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	141814.681265
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	173581.238590
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	33451.611838
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	142933.869781

SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	137262.900831
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	110586.420145
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	138425.333555

SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	59377.457901
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	154011.896442
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	103695.589697

SOS i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement EOS	106331.559708
SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	137231.021164
SOS they then went away EOS	19757.326651
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	139270.465132
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	78635.980237

SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	145852.938040
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	140050.952782
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	128107.904240

SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	123302.784971
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	138679.887798
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	138656.075371

SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	73949.958966
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	166576.990768
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	131812.477133

SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	149564.227340

SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	142564.596990

SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	129607.666332

SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	151665.358847
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	155625.920751
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	169320.097399
