SOS bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied EOS	1059.883551
SOS on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion EOS	203.714154
SOS in understanding darcy was the superior EOS	363.111560
SOS bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever EOS	381.805109
SOS he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting EOS	575.290241
SOS in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage EOS	198.180516
SOS bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence EOS	979.627451
SOS the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic EOS	679.198560
SOS bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful EOS	451.367309
SOS darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure EOS	504.640865
SOS miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much EOS	168.112430
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of EOS	131.540597
SOS miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose EOS	405.570903
SOS within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate EOS	388.564243
SOS sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty EOS	574.628355
SOS the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly EOS	2625.744156
SOS it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world EOS	402.002518
SOS for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body EOS	416.922241
SOS by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st EOS	219.501438
SOS james s had made him courteous EOS	369.976222

SOS the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend EOS	606.643178
SOS that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate EOS	162.324667
SOS you began the evening well charlotte said TITLE bennet with civil self command to miss lucas EOS	473.842682

SOS you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice EOS	293.256592
SOS to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about TITLE robinson EOS	225.079662
SOS perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and TITLE robinson did not i mention it to you EOS	265.715325
SOS TITLE robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest EOS	346.367605
SOS and his answering immediately to the last question oh EOS	343.241516
SOS the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point EOS	365.852921
SOS upon my word EOS	22.693623
SOS well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know EOS	271.802748

SOS TITLE long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips EOS	118.921302
SOS are you quite sure ma am EOS	71.194059
SOS is not there a little mistake EOS	92.019035
SOS said jane EOS	47.759665
SOS i certainly saw TITLE darcy speaking to her EOS	93.320116
SOS aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to EOS	311.020587
SOS miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance EOS	572.692935
SOS with them he is remarkably agreeable EOS	531.768627
SOS i do not believe a word of it my dear EOS	27.763687
SOS if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to TITLE long EOS	41.915567
SOS but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that TITLE long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise EOS	292.973890
SOS i do not mind his not talking to TITLE long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza EOS	202.883814
SOS another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you EOS	109.679859
SOS i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him EOS	169.848398
SOS his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it EOS	272.750838
SOS one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself EOS	193.826276
SOS if i may so express it he has a right to be proud EOS	203.552528
SOS that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine EOS	191.573939
SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	2320.307528
SOS by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary EOS	280.284719
SOS vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously EOS	4836.672278
SOS a person may be proud without being vain EOS	546.669075
SOS pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us EOS	728.950246
SOS if i were as rich as TITLE darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was EOS	229.945300
SOS i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day EOS	2146.625879
SOS then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said TITLE bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly EOS	162.290744
SOS the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit EOS	313.409101
SOS the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield EOS	370.920859
SOS the visit was returned in due form EOS	971.127681
SOS miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of TITLE hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest EOS	183.848325
SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	278.266668
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	170.184214
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	81.298998
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	230.287591
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	322.250362
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	254.406116
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	456.603195
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	1660.984139
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	282.911244
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	215.793643
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	191.655657
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	252.587273
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	85.139644
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	223.897462
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	409.376754
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	167.077335
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	113.145139
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	304.964414
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	155.851552
SOS as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness EOS	338.711641
SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	98.183093
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	253.596264
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	38.871377
SOS not as you represent it EOS	539.308501
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	708.668025
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	1288.137811
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	126.742162
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	933.231120
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	462.355174
SOS they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life EOS	295.221154
SOS you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound EOS	356.879931
SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	129.798760
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	159.233663
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	245.975362
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	200.197795
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	2444.304724
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	546.091792
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	231.799978
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	174.245406
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	1062.289267
SOS it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled EOS	60.926595
SOS what does TITLE darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster EOS	217.947396
SOS that is a question which TITLE darcy only can answer EOS	31.186613
SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	87.634880
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	414.868260
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	235.157539
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	713.736397
SOS you are severe on us EOS	281.001730
SOS it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas EOS	213.674908
SOS i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows EOS	141.140175
SOS you are a very strange creature by way of a friend EOS	171.225217
SOS always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body EOS	120.124422
SOS if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers EOS	293.389355
SOS on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must EOS	133.733414
SOS and gravely glancing at TITLE darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song EOS	1705.049433
SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	1139.602622
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	579.335540
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	1410.914881
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	447.199560
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	248.503155
SOS what a charming amusement for young people this is TITLE darcy EOS	247.917055
SOS there is nothing like dancing after all EOS	281.249345
SOS i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies EOS	433.823269
SOS certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world EOS	783.240862
SOS every savage can dance EOS	4001.637037
SOS sir william only smiled EOS	343.376729

SOS you have a house in town i conclude EOS	67.126219
SOS TITLE darcy bowed EOS	403.919801
SOS i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas EOS	317.259481
SOS he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing EOS	246.385949
SOS TITLE darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner EOS	93.436800
SOS you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you EOS	240.976389

SOS you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour EOS	236.428584
SOS TITLE darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling EOS	118.683724

SOS the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt EOS	641.752585
SOS at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters EOS	507.164010

SOS said jane EOS	47.759665
SOS no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night EOS	316.197924
SOS that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home EOS	99.254094
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS but the gentlemen will have TITLE bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs EOS	374.111459
SOS i had much rather go in the coach EOS	98.973547
SOS but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure EOS	145.331500
SOS they are wanted in the farm TITLE bennet are not they EOS	262.175765
SOS they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them EOS	207.029868
SOS but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered EOS	140.310487
SOS she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged EOS	307.595086
SOS jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day EOS	350.405118
SOS her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard EOS	727.338631
SOS her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted EOS	147.020321
SOS the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back EOS	700.193200
SOS this was a lucky idea of mine indeed EOS	197.453115
SOS said TITLE bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own EOS	132.173455
SOS till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance EOS	89.702145
SOS breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday EOS	803.774349
SOS my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better EOS	356.328292

SOS yours c EOS	28.169028
SOS well my dear said TITLE bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of TITLE bingley and under your orders EOS	204.206751

SOS as long as she stays there it is all very well EOS	143.795645
SOS i would go and see her if i could have the carriage EOS	56.645711
SOS elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative EOS	293.178233
SOS she declared her resolution EOS	286.812151
SOS how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt EOS	78.987039
SOS you will not be fit to be seen when you get there EOS	78.084093
SOS i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want EOS	113.745398

SOS no indeed EOS	44.207313

SOS the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles EOS	530.605680
SOS i shall be back by dinner EOS	125.330177
SOS i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required EOS	552.225718
SOS we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia EOS	138.710909
SOS elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together EOS	70.900481
SOS if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes EOS	924.670360
SOS in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise EOS	2249.315234
SOS she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise EOS	218.656400
SOS that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to TITLE hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it EOS	169.154050
SOS she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness EOS	159.456392
SOS TITLE darcy said very little and TITLE hurst nothing at all EOS	64.989842
SOS the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone EOS	346.336461
SOS the latter was thinking only of his breakfast EOS	201.187493
SOS her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered EOS	239.902395
SOS miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room EOS	269.221432
SOS elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance EOS	263.573841
SOS she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with EOS	409.908205
SOS elizabeth silently attended her EOS	207.443134
SOS when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane EOS	185.863666
SOS the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts EOS	311.925029
SOS the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely EOS	4609.720395
SOS elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere EOS	336.200267
SOS when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so EOS	506.473202
SOS miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present EOS	160.797970
SOS elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes EOS	1093.155864
SOS at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner EOS	625.002374
SOS to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of TITLE bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer EOS	204.850478
SOS jane was by no means better EOS	66.367935
SOS the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike EOS	666.160932
SOS their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency EOS	198.172679
SOS his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others EOS	302.552462
SOS she had very little notice from any but him EOS	192.566887
SOS miss bingley was engrossed by TITLE darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for TITLE hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her EOS	288.207450
SOS when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room EOS	106.742503
SOS her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty EOS	729.343377
SOS TITLE hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker EOS	469.572588
SOS i shall never forget her appearance this morning EOS	73.783488
SOS she really looked almost wild EOS	1261.511618

SOS i could hardly keep my countenance EOS	133.475224
SOS very nonsensical to come at all EOS	249.872974
SOS why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold EOS	439.058728
SOS her hair so untidy so blowsy EOS	5041.062885
SOS yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office EOS	1009.757839
SOS your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me EOS	954.024191
SOS i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning EOS	133.931733
SOS her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice EOS	5454.120788
SOS you observed it TITLE darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition EOS	62.838566
SOS certainly not EOS	119.086932
SOS to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone EOS	815.641131
SOS what could she mean by it EOS	118.906645
SOS it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum EOS	1467.084134
SOS it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley EOS	131.314133
SOS i am afraid TITLE darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes EOS	390.626812
SOS not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise EOS	179.437167
SOS a short pause followed this speech and TITLE hurst began again EOS	310.093378
SOS i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled EOS	319.357762
SOS but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it EOS	74.537798
SOS i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton EOS	67.126530
SOS yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside EOS	903.094068
SOS that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily EOS	380.576792
SOS if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable EOS	914.721220
SOS but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy EOS	213.093772
SOS to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations EOS	1187.097847
SOS with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee EOS	195.876048
SOS she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself EOS	199.432603
SOS on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book EOS	396.649677
SOS TITLE hurst looked at her with astonishment EOS	59.295759
SOS do you prefer reading to cards EOS	1162.923063
SOS said he that is rather singular EOS	382.720808
SOS miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards EOS	601.281885
SOS she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else EOS	294.756471
SOS i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things EOS	544.117445
SOS in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well EOS	127.151141
SOS elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying EOS	296.287967
SOS he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded EOS	394.034589
SOS and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into EOS	306.209015
SOS elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room EOS	308.748135
SOS i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books EOS	185.931309
SOS what a delightful library you have at pemberley TITLE darcy EOS	118.696123
SOS it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations EOS	119.111713
SOS and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books EOS	244.195051
SOS i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these EOS	293.418528
SOS neglect EOS	4667.667682

SOS charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley EOS	892.287795
SOS i wish it may EOS	96.239358
SOS but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model EOS	301.287793
SOS there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire EOS	271.911614
SOS with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it EOS	1102.624637
SOS i am talking of possibilities charles EOS	999.776006
SOS upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation EOS	621.765665
SOS elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between TITLE bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game EOS	282.937631
SOS is miss darcy much grown since the spring EOS	531.493412
SOS said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am EOS	204.733582

SOS and so extremely accomplished for her age EOS	515.020666

SOS all young ladies accomplished EOS	463.780645
SOS my dear charles what do you mean EOS	110.327003
SOS yes all of them i think EOS	114.038876
SOS they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses EOS	23141.416566
SOS i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished EOS	109.597040
SOS your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth EOS	410.675432
SOS the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen EOS	1607.005841
SOS but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general EOS	179.699972
SOS i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished EOS	166.421300
SOS nor i i am sure said miss bingley EOS	50.616150

SOS yes i do comprehend a great deal in it EOS	87.041733
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with EOS	2075.089431
SOS a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved EOS	572.415964
SOS all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading EOS	422.845923
SOS i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women EOS	622.737991
SOS i rather wonder now at your knowing any EOS	593.528697
SOS are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this EOS	93.486237
SOS i never saw such a woman EOS	18.756604
SOS i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united EOS	431.394888
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when TITLE hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward EOS	539.179089
SOS as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room EOS	307.529277
SOS eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds EOS	285.728329
SOS but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art EOS	449.538016
SOS undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation EOS	3543.188386
SOS whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable EOS	11425.834338
SOS miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject EOS	101.407629
SOS elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her EOS	81.840532
SOS bingley urged TITLE jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians EOS	1252.493260
SOS this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that TITLE jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better EOS	86.694017
SOS bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable EOS	511.575444
SOS they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister EOS	856.590743
SOS elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from TITLE bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters EOS	185.785235
SOS in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation EOS	458.612313

SOS TITLE bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast EOS	660.520671
SOS had she found jane in any apparent danger TITLE bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield EOS	599.994103
SOS she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable EOS	557.890614
SOS after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour EOS	233.725642
SOS bingley met them with hopes that TITLE bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected EOS	162.252599

SOS you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us EOS	196.995172
SOS TITLE bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments EOS	502.399241
SOS i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with EOS	202.191597

SOS you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease EOS	208.754920

SOS yes but intricate characters are the most amusing EOS	1715.762711
SOS they have at least that advantage EOS	134.234701

SOS no she would go home EOS	73.391335

SOS for my part TITLE bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently EOS	628.448005
SOS but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you EOS	65.021387
SOS it is a pity they are not handsome EOS	64.286419
SOS not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend EOS	393.296789
SOS she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley EOS	322.584068
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS dear yes but you must own she is very plain EOS	269.743644
SOS lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty EOS	796.296619

SOS it is what every body says EOS	95.511895
SOS i do not trust my own partiality EOS	90.820808
SOS when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away EOS	73.545541
SOS but however he did not EOS	28.172015
SOS perhaps he thought her too young EOS	246.375367
SOS however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were EOS	415.771437
SOS and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently EOS	423.189203
SOS there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way EOS	170.979551
SOS i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love EOS	3931.691413
SOS i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy EOS	268.329480
SOS of a fine stout healthy love it may EOS	2007.004191
SOS every thing nourishes what is strong already EOS	1181.329854
SOS but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away EOS	446.294024
SOS darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again EOS	1394.332527
SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	131.484240
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	540.197196
SOS she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but TITLE bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage EOS	446.695609
SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	393.541127
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	141.061203
SOS lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age EOS	799.748579
SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	479.157648
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	232.745743
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	536.339334
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	116.750856
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	85.798418
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	684.567449
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	350.290179
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	296.745613
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	129.193278
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	152.254864
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	61.522195
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	173.804978
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	615.443379
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	432.553305
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	560.955671
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	457.755946
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	684.225950
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	159.342619
SOS he made no answer EOS	16.925122
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	3328.142521
SOS you are mistaken EOS	22.175571
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	1784.742136

SOS letters of business too EOS	1577.484547
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	407.286666
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	516.627106
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	50.957646
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	408.210324

SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	224.307204
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	222.726378
SOS he was silent EOS	26.030977
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	260.688874
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	241.949587
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	123.594866
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	143.056138
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	156.352075
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	399.975341
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	217.846551
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	533.139110
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	189.181888
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	1760.714647
SOS do not you darcy EOS	68.974097
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	598.118235
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	3401.210447
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	1186.434984
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	1320.379733
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	1069.080418
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	634.338671
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	1655.179801
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	534.706715
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	1271.093793
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	536.599469
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	320.188519
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	354.999418
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	89.347669
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	759.941285
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	69.402125
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	471.115941
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	83.932409
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	376.510386
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	576.807347
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	200.367512
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	2125.653569
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	339.547666
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	221.094454
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	801.742614
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	434.019278
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	582.807285
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	175.673263
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	1939.398034
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	99.216600
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	1351.645209
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	612.932409
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	885.916510
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	566.512542
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	187.942534
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	697.577399
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	166.875218
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	1405.471920
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	256.190626
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	903.047885
SOS perhaps i do EOS	40.302936
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	1419.157697
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	148.860765
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	203.422108
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	227.667082
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	96.906798
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	837.153944
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	391.592423
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	121.203930
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	316.152622
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	220.655363
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	113.919254
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	675.180117
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	102.632687
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	358.827961
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	74.625509
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	895.251794
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	254.011064
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	119.473881
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	366.663753
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	74.174840
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	377.535781
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	887.371455
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	131.166624
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	1266.000333
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	147.513174
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS yes EOS	32.630845
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	194.645663
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	910.987723
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	428.289578
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	332.658336
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	1166.263735
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	116.315945
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	153.166565
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	608.057494
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	402.138222
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	5922.388847
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	785.747475
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	250.659686
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	232.655043
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	3997.761328
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	2855.101245
SOS good bye EOS	44.020188
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	298.453828
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	228.120423
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	229.681867
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	1375.719965
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	1501.119318
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	50.417160
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	173.253976
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	363.644654
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	229.569987
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	155.873746
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	62.556949
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	414.802681
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	138.999884
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	721.050193
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	89.978636
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	415.151967
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	376.412300
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	230.360904
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	405.719550
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	291.528780
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	518.917379
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	412.239516
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	82.277509
SOS no one made any reply EOS	120.679959
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	675.056062
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	238.780746
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	621.891747
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	380.844657
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	677.306049
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	169.851384
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	57.005010
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	993.742287
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	260.004514
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	276.986845
SOS elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately EOS	69.576068
SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	162.398090
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	529.837073
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	721.885315
SOS what could he mean EOS	98.475912
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	230.297104
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	285.943401
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	497.412882
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	114.203103
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	744.540048
SOS oh EOS	13.389684
SOS shocking EOS	1080.813403
SOS cried miss bingley EOS	110.866685

SOS TITLE darcy may hug himself EOS	329.087050
SOS TITLE darcy is not to be laughed at EOS	48.668635
