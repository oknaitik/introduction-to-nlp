SOS jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail EOS	61.429206

SOS it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said TITLE bennet and nothing can clear TITLE collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn EOS	5.105968

SOS my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england EOS	5.194392
SOS as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch EOS	10.730360

SOS if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day EOS	12.878118

SOS lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth EOS	7.071350
SOS she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them EOS	5.991408

SOS you judge very properly said TITLE bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy EOS	3.775534

SOS a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility EOS	8.480364

SOS when this information was given and they had all taken their seats TITLE collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when TITLE philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room EOS	8.426300

SOS TITLE wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker EOS	8.563029

SOS when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence EOS	10329.068276
SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	11534.469207
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	11995.629473
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	19904.462612
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	7044.303641
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	14386.156646
SOS he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said EOS	11042.113362
SOS very well EOS	712.672593
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	11125.269929
SOS perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones EOS	18860.684056

SOS sometimes EOS	7213.986851
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	9712.035916
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	9467.988277
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	11703.408095
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	15368.401628
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	18260.323885
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	7674.665552
SOS how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say EOS	7004.896425
SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	6750.559702
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	12631.161044
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	9890.679589
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	13832.702033
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	25882.437364
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	11573.201233
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	14606.096621
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	8712.235618
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	4822.164149
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	11150.205833
SOS i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir EOS	6311.890891
SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	15096.150185
SOS it is evident that you belong to the first circles EOS	18812.963965
SOS allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place EOS	13152.250395
SOS what congratulations will then flow in EOS	25472.858782
SOS i appeal to TITLE darcy but let me not interrupt you sir EOS	11448.226354
SOS you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me EOS	12155.510274
SOS the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together EOS	16863.449264
SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	13748.388421
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	2629.339588
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	11521.889598

SOS what think you of books EOS	10814.808424
SOS said he smiling EOS	3310.155723

SOS no EOS	419.530213

SOS i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject EOS	13414.063122
SOS we may compare our different opinions EOS	19904.462612
SOS no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else EOS	10695.728211
SOS the present always occupies you in such scenes does it EOS	21458.931879
SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	2401.640324
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	16988.839823
SOS you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created EOS	6458.873314
SOS i am said he with a firm voice EOS	17744.216741
SOS and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice EOS	25169.933906

SOS she shook her head EOS	7671.713900
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	3698.726955
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	15326.718609
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	11993.615364
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	12233.052297
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	14150.550861
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	15934.541734
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	10240.645899
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	9099.194832
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	12362.852299
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	7462.873385
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	13778.075133
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	19551.058591
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	11383.392946
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	10779.164125

SOS you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this EOS	9409.012317
SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	10249.677194
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	16835.159969
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	8784.641381
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	12306.804328
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	11393.717602
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	10341.194103
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	6129.629044
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	8545.211810
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	8445.037004
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	5989.293117
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	13193.683951
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	8683.823119
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	10748.995686
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	13872.411781
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	12331.220409
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	7894.677232
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	12076.144908
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	14871.944896
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	10357.251907
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	12108.105327
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	13099.191276
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	11794.211392
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	9303.483754
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	6688.324967
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	12460.785894
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	25106.141687
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	1662.249804
SOS indeed i am EOS	1364.602864
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	10993.727673
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	5474.312825
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	6623.744360
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	10257.062310
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	13967.938091
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	11857.150070
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	16091.333875
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	15961.288893
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	12498.449963
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	8574.426817
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	10982.331022
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	13865.215110
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	17402.308353
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	4733.717742
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	8835.311057
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	10126.940725
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	13735.919543
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	4302.910807
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	14590.785500
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	18120.787574
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	15462.521967
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	9756.019394
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	10578.498076
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	10482.823440
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	13163.704959
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	10976.828052
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	16006.810165
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	11110.960568
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	17471.701046
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	5449.809455

SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	5785.873248
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	10323.157183
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	13152.520751
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	15773.945539
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	9467.222031
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	21551.058613
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	9103.700477
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	19230.136629
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	17698.808661
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	14346.690870
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	16205.404036
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	11827.610652
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	9197.367227
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	12752.435156
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	13427.214290
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	10657.464802
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	15358.227682
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	4883.814889

SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	13171.194406
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	9538.371976
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	13294.406984
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	11877.469088
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	12531.167397
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	15350.193185
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	8254.474211
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	11382.400536

SOS many stared EOS	8611.522571
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	11782.626930
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	10723.849016
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	10240.972325
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	5659.239552
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	8848.915116
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	12931.688234
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	11539.615800
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	4690.843057

SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	14900.579352

SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	14727.164914

SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	14749.334954
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	17107.987336
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	13308.974944

SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	17352.418449

SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	14741.369596
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	14716.976036

SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	12768.121769
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	13021.378084
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	18098.898972
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	10878.403992

SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	17143.697347

SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	18196.137113
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	11110.485202

SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	13880.649877
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	19311.852057
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	11360.982913

SOS hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort EOS	13734.817281

SOS had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself EOS	10148.948224

SOS elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time TITLE bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them EOS	7690.951016
SOS TITLE bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity EOS	13048.574550
SOS her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day EOS	11887.090963
SOS TITLE bennet s best comfort was that TITLE bingley must be down again in the summer EOS	6459.081127

SOS true said TITLE bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it EOS	8494.401650
SOS TITLE wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family EOS	13673.980144
SOS they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve EOS	12333.299628
SOS the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on TITLE darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked TITLE darcy before they had known any thing of the matter EOS	9487.010025
SOS miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else TITLE darcy was condemned as the worst of men EOS	13110.058991
SOS after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity TITLE collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday EOS	9947.833251

SOS he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks EOS	16497.038536

SOS TITLE gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation EOS	10536.552596

SOS an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us EOS	5657.267599
SOS we do not suffer by accident EOS	25472.858782
SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	7189.393862
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	17764.985202
SOS it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment EOS	23211.009978
SOS pray how violent was TITLE bingley s love EOS	9402.628227
SOS i never saw a more promising inclination EOS	10179.671938

SOS change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything EOS	18484.557139
SOS elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence EOS	10871.185064
SOS i hope added TITLE gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her EOS	12787.834576
SOS we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her EOS	15378.701926
SOS and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and TITLE darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london EOS	9312.972512
SOS my dear aunt how could you think of it EOS	3109.843431
SOS TITLE darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it TITLE bingley never stirs without him EOS	14337.500807

SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	9661.765174
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	16436.969094
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	14777.289902

SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	12358.266224
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	14193.571307
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	8425.690395
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	8012.509714
SOS here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse EOS	13445.286422

SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	12565.951637

SOS TITLE darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer EOS	6766.273075
SOS when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument EOS	12742.970068
SOS he drew a chair near her EOS	25472.858782
SOS lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance EOS	16937.430204
SOS elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me TITLE darcy by coming in all this state to hear me EOS	15395.620221
SOS but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well EOS	6090.539344
SOS there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others EOS	8451.131140
SOS my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me EOS	25106.141687
SOS i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own EOS	9173.853565
SOS elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say EOS	17979.450925
SOS i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit EOS	16334.711292
SOS indeed TITLE darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear EOS	13646.073757
SOS i am not afraid of you said he smilingly EOS	6331.490367
SOS pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam EOS	5666.637670
SOS i should like to know how he behaves among strangers EOS	7326.983439
SOS you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful EOS	9223.249863
SOS the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did EOS	11260.879004
SOS he danced only four dances EOS	8110.302651
SOS i am sorry to pain you but so it was EOS	9006.513843
SOS he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner EOS	18162.666855
SOS TITLE darcy you cannot deny the fact EOS	10557.245241
SOS i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party EOS	10143.241098
SOS true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room EOS	14359.852491
SOS well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next EOS	11371.128094
SOS my fingers wait your orders EOS	19230.136629
SOS perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers EOS	11351.458498
SOS shall we ask your cousin the reason of this EOS	5802.721087
SOS said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam EOS	4992.351214
SOS shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers EOS	8335.078711
SOS i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him EOS	11045.681160
SOS it is because he will not give himself the trouble EOS	20622.020821
SOS i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before EOS	18872.573051
SOS i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done EOS	19522.060899
SOS my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do EOS	21321.708929
SOS they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression EOS	10027.100944
SOS but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising EOS	9078.151781
SOS it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution EOS	11381.951083
SOS darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right EOS	9333.954752
SOS you have employed your time much better EOS	4401.627228
SOS no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting EOS	12267.127317
SOS we neither of us perform to strangers EOS	18675.272228
SOS here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of EOS	6153.615189
SOS elizabeth immediately began playing again EOS	19230.136629
SOS lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master EOS	11718.170882
SOS she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s EOS	15321.946816
SOS anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn EOS	11330.116105
SOS elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation EOS	9250.954675
SOS lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste EOS	12916.430241
SOS elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home EOS	11551.829152
SOS elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while TITLE collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor EOS	12134.545853
SOS as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise TITLE darcy and TITLE darcy only entered the room EOS	10690.442145
SOS he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within EOS	22072.662241
SOS they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence EOS	14053.360175
SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	11191.106337
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	9089.139997
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	16520.799127
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	10566.626707
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	8588.596226
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	9347.546366
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	15412.929338
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	13105.492118
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	15673.500411
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	10788.884323
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	1597.719880
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	7858.589298
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	14301.008299
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	5091.764740
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	7332.293034
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	25642.722910
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	11675.320761
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	15925.972259
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	13310.566101
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	6698.023431
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	11301.915563
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	26863.914738
SOS and what is fifty miles of good road EOS	11595.883472
SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	9378.925365
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	8184.540499
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	5221.024963
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	4120.480483
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	9325.562919
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	19126.334527
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	9788.360354
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	22225.335990
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	14395.082935
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	6186.491279
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	13944.249719
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	12166.804063
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	3116.971722
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	11989.675916
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	21304.195437
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	7297.037042
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	15553.324237
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	10794.392242
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	8733.663560
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	5365.098465
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	8190.206778
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	13170.212498
SOS all field sports were over EOS	11855.498568
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	16512.109563
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	12965.152714
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	14590.716036
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	16863.036944
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	15310.369174
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	25642.722910
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	6863.016292
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	10968.210237
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	15421.226023
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	12089.381495
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	16035.793092
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	10357.546990
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	17883.805952
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	12524.240007
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	11932.963025
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	12774.710933
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	10047.457203
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	9445.759743
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	16592.260048
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	12437.983187
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	25472.858782
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	9279.243160
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	22768.058362
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	10202.579345
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	13368.413194
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	12558.135491
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	12019.280250
SOS are you going much farther EOS	6272.007993
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	2672.620672
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	15285.917612
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	7600.323014
SOS said she EOS	599.376898
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	11659.703216
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	4097.934190
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	19245.163809
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	11480.444993
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	7043.031300
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	15285.917612
SOS but so we all do EOS	10814.808424
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	14361.827270
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	17044.884611
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	11399.145703
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	12464.421933
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	9966.804432
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	16545.901005
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	9123.426221
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	11032.672047
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	19725.256139
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	19443.460533
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	18634.573705
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	6671.319117
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	14248.093013
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	14269.410463
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	12877.246882
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	12427.851854
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	11881.585745
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	10788.557463
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	9508.738493
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	8279.257382
SOS are you indeed EOS	3174.902665
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	12124.743968
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	16936.284217
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	12451.727766
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	10918.071987
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	12594.053957
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	3965.328449
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	5392.243509

SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	8230.258769
SOS care of him EOS	4388.949904
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	9111.140647
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	11983.432725
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	7202.539289
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	14623.251325
SOS what is it you mean EOS	5871.069478
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	12045.186269
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	2461.597939
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	8290.796548
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	15206.448755
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	14468.497348
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	9869.546141
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	16776.525927
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	9906.425115
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	10269.169636
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	8450.643370
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	10990.544882
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	10117.704314
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	14058.729996
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	6510.394827
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	7508.308560
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	8792.604889
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	13744.312666
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	3459.925581
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	10995.378293
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	10495.318526
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	6623.392249
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	8941.782727
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	10045.144376
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	7942.627215
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	14127.123627
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	11972.395885
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	12093.331828

SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	14085.502627
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	15762.028129

SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	8496.096671

SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	12725.684542
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	11445.963582
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	14301.597619
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	7284.879877
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	17798.407303
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	7398.923795

SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	12020.463103
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	9945.166393
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	16457.878842
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	11789.651768
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	15541.475848
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	13819.454308

SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	17099.421060

SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	14102.025377
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	17321.179428
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	17915.095004
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	15357.000892
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	10442.368141
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	15926.328868
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	6856.770554
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	9316.271457
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	12777.759097

SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	10060.204125
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	11619.136276
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	13708.683304

SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	10223.069443
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	10756.624672
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	12939.230047

SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	16365.298533
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	2863.629225
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	16703.003713
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	10284.638385
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	15207.998844
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	3643.894220
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	19904.462612

SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	14211.162695
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	10173.118443
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	21098.946450
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	12692.080300
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	10858.085704
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	11214.023346
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	8423.664045
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	18941.578188
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	10186.853226

SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	11314.605550
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	14541.178598
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	6511.433505
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	15940.452675
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	12581.262656

SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	12638.617702
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	12241.373792

SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	18341.558139
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	13260.309521
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	9187.598143
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	15300.277594
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	14383.081729
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	14907.499535
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	16941.916050
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	17498.291466
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	24477.044567

SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	12379.901767
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	10798.902593
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	10179.430915
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	10415.726894
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	17476.879014
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	19744.691505
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	6477.507883
SOS again she read on EOS	12268.818211
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	16269.978560
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	15655.291296
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	10781.649728

SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	16911.348326
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	12720.863279
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	15260.011552
SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	14113.346048

SOS the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question EOS	13572.232585
SOS at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that TITLE darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration EOS	9339.508964
SOS she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at TITLE philips s EOS	16867.577132

SOS she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before EOS	13821.959299
SOS she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct EOS	12034.873705
SOS she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing TITLE darcy that TITLE darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week EOS	10654.644849
SOS she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking TITLE darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son EOS	17727.525017
SOS how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned EOS	7697.791283
SOS his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing EOS	18320.283669
SOS his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn EOS	16433.116742
SOS every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of TITLE darcy she could not but allow that TITLE bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits EOS	13114.143587
SOS that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling EOS	15246.699820
SOS that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as TITLE bingley was incomprehensible EOS	15080.984071

SOS when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe EOS	6489.651463

SOS to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther EOS	10587.383587
SOS it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where TITLE bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs EOS	15430.890545

SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun EOS	10351.407021
SOS as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too EOS	13541.720167
SOS and then when we came away it was such fun EOS	10867.864049
SOS i thought we never should have got into the coach EOS	13056.543437
SOS i was ready to die of laughter EOS	9741.057550

SOS to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures EOS	8427.498255

SOS she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents EOS	12559.171723
SOS elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last EOS	11633.641905
SOS elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	8561.038312
SOS miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings EOS	15433.828960
SOS she was sorry that TITLE darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him EOS	12490.514029
SOS his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment EOS	17355.740835

SOS who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual EOS	13748.416495
SOS nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery EOS	12310.912088

SOS poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance EOS	10527.003680
SOS such an openness and gentleness in his manner EOS	11506.910467

SOS i never thought TITLE darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do EOS	7242.834883
SOS and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason EOS	15951.325002
SOS it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind EOS	14981.987108

SOS i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character EOS	11147.376462

SOS the general prejudice against TITLE darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light EOS	11612.863694
SOS i am not equal to it EOS	6406.906430
SOS wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is EOS	8888.440679

SOS she dared not relate the other half of TITLE darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend EOS	8098.449166
SOS here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery EOS	14943.795607
SOS and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself EOS	15518.001168

SOS having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity EOS	15651.876649
SOS well lizzy said TITLE bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s EOS	8035.811144

SOS it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance EOS	17840.314454

SOS he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived EOS	11726.386994

SOS thought elizabeth EOS	13765.609308

SOS that is not very likely our authority was too good EOS	11054.956485
SOS on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley EOS	12372.174066
SOS he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows EOS	8861.843117

SOS in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger EOS	14512.476481
SOS elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her EOS	12103.820430
SOS at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of TITLE darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her EOS	9138.832126
SOS she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery EOS	21043.294232
SOS TITLE reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s life time EOS	8316.795303
SOS there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance EOS	9754.571276
SOS the commendation bestowed on him by TITLE reynolds was of no trifling nature EOS	24969.987978
SOS what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant EOS	25008.315373
SOS as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship EOS	18211.796657
SOS how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow EOS	5213.056067
SOS how much of good or evil must be done by him EOS	5322.956354
SOS every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression EOS	15225.289569
SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	16467.211666
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	15956.209777
SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	6756.673065
SOS their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush EOS	15940.748093
SOS he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility EOS	18246.286289
SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	15150.206233
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	15997.106395
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	11296.730838
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	14194.498173
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	15167.579786
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	11708.914017
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	11255.630684
SOS she was overpowered by shame and vexation EOS	6960.057959
SOS her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world EOS	11172.657753
SOS how strange must it appear to him EOS	5200.177825
SOS in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man EOS	11736.404144
SOS it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again EOS	18261.924834
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS why did she come EOS	5299.906335
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	11470.920458
SOS had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage EOS	10671.710759
SOS she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting EOS	10954.411261
SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	25106.141687
SOS that he should even speak to her was amazing EOS	7274.931773
SOS but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family EOS	8645.193817
SOS never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting EOS	20007.901993
SOS what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing s park when he put his letter into her hand EOS	19535.782685
SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	4327.761462
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	10736.431727
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	17384.328084
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	6930.648927
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	13997.770267
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	13703.486845
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	9225.176096
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	14950.936011
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	12781.208540
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	8516.148490
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	16944.208772
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	18057.040679
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	10645.042747
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	16619.096052
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	10309.361182
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	17387.653694
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	15800.269287
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	6679.193311
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	22984.017848
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	16143.306260
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	8573.023946
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	8802.688935
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	11651.749778
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	15808.706384
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	25248.122337
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	14304.587763
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	10806.624670
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	4726.534888
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	14775.854283
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	20091.601614
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	15814.756507
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	11894.247990
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	17229.657035
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	19193.085426
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	6448.894562
SOS it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened EOS	9470.453146
SOS my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this EOS	16517.854891
SOS it is impossible that he should still love me EOS	10792.771630
SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	12796.461412
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	15953.617466
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	8781.727849
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	4541.457999
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	10347.040324
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	9158.063364
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	9871.043742
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	8936.107379
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	11362.475854
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	13545.441062
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	10458.698565
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	12151.976892
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	6414.480728
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	11154.261514
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	12138.804981
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	8112.596220
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	14670.584241
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	6165.017948
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	14258.608047
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	8028.840268
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	16843.653049
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	6641.569977
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	11962.029884
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	10054.208636
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	10993.727673
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	8389.406318

SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	5489.387198
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	11334.267469

SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	7056.467863
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	12616.354225
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	14791.920763

SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	12199.461752
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	8737.782837
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	8348.473121

SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	10413.333288
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	11337.930022
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	10268.256669
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	11323.680273
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	9377.582313
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	13934.437847
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	11106.592943
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	9931.504097
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	14495.283569
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	11626.069661
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	21939.299779
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	13328.518878
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	14128.183479
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	14381.398598
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	16649.812136
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	13122.993902

SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	12876.000354
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	7731.807968
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	15304.776267

SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	16776.752488

SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	8720.383296
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	10136.543467
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	12284.637189
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	10513.742327
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	12718.671230
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	11059.870315
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	8087.513296
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	15487.690099
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	12353.650194
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	19110.967237
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	7731.855909
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	10968.163088
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	11229.609938
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	17082.653116
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	10357.474327
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	13436.722587
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	12912.525790

SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	8237.346506
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	11255.161207
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	11418.393632
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	16665.049614
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	14491.911335
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	14437.915261

SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	15029.602439

SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	17231.083551

SOS he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister EOS	15846.139363
SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	11683.163112
SOS she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses EOS	15447.354488
SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	9653.939561

SOS her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace EOS	17786.084992

SOS but self though it would intrude could not engross her EOS	25106.141687
SOS lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern EOS	13827.981425

SOS he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away EOS	18947.992991
SOS as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination EOS	13887.454138
SOS if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty EOS	22846.664525
SOS but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment EOS	17676.550144
SOS be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business EOS	14997.844268

SOS while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible EOS	14456.856013
SOS but now it was all too natural EOS	8651.389636
SOS for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey EOS	12834.879579
SOS she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body EOS	9931.612686

SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	8506.208481
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	16895.011823
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	15751.641407

SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	20220.614605
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	12457.555300
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	10070.653791
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	11907.689048
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	12623.372307
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	11068.857953

SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	5472.513303
SOS not perhaps of neglecting his own interest EOS	13083.919164

SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	5658.944068
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	19435.475474
SOS and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road EOS	16073.846638
SOS well then supposing them to be in london EOS	2447.307508
SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	11298.466729
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	14166.392696
SOS but why all this secrecy EOS	11356.427116
SOS why any fear of detection EOS	8380.874732

SOS no no this is not likely EOS	3128.390977

SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	13222.917896
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	18324.285436
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	17528.907759
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	11558.558633
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	13746.001441
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	15793.741727
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	14372.095787
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	11691.629880
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	3865.341211
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	6027.076227
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	14811.934944
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	10376.220470
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	12605.419945
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	9370.259042
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	19170.888979
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	15768.846277
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	8448.599047
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	14211.162695
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	16480.545250
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	6974.973769
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	12439.377437
SOS that he has neither integrity nor honour EOS	10593.903395
SOS that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating EOS	9608.120875
SOS and do you really know all this EOS	5902.918948
SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	8422.474737
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	8627.692746
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	8442.680210
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	12796.809197
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	8248.379032
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	11721.230922
SOS he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her EOS	8882.483391
SOS but does lydia know nothing of this EOS	10171.874099

SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	9774.350050
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	15595.858231
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	14571.090826
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	6902.948704
SOS that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head EOS	13918.515592
SOS that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts EOS	21062.311137
SOS when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other EOS	7337.092719
SOS not the slightest EOS	6993.856641
SOS i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away EOS	9841.849574
SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	8023.465913
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	17152.350989
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	15620.052850
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	11762.013553
SOS fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness EOS	24477.044567

SOS how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine EOS	7850.392857

SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	14231.419698

SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	14445.960264
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	11279.192197
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	18079.498521
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	16460.392805

SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	6830.918833
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	13037.792202
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	11604.530886
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	9597.133917
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	12371.699364
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	13429.913933
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	7657.579406
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	7384.774741

SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	8368.397197
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	25472.858782
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	19808.684152
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	10217.286001
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	6497.489486
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	11541.546551
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	14440.406310
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	16765.006864
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	7570.186370
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	11542.126116
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	6664.231691
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	11170.408681
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	17623.155393
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	9762.370412
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	11331.144113
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	5659.501276

SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	10471.058966
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	11707.482928
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	9450.364129
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	8971.433425

SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	8770.985545
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	9661.876879
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	16719.968820
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	18346.541921
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	25642.722910

SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	16224.217623
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	13335.827545
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	18454.167744
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	8832.614151
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	9900.193331
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	13824.977829
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	10840.181584
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	13123.562576
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	6168.227773
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	7411.528680
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	13360.093514
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	14499.791680
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	15056.438656

SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	8670.728026

SOS very well EOS	712.672593
SOS i shall now know how to act EOS	8359.200060
SOS do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified EOS	6945.349916
SOS i came to try you EOS	14421.173447
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	14813.804338
SOS in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet EOS	10525.402855
SOS i send no compliments to your mother EOS	15049.796031
SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	5859.337129
SOS i am most seriously displeased EOS	20145.939750
SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	8660.923329
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	19294.867495
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	13912.775880
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	11795.679840
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	4632.717183
SOS and her calling here was prodigiously civil EOS	20425.679921
SOS for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well EOS	12135.461326
SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	13594.894246
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	11022.263510
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	11603.115577
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	13405.973674
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	10856.020518
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	9266.547184
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	16676.009775
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	7498.114469
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	16557.328929
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	9666.273668
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	11445.170845
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	13071.466581
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	15967.701498
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	12542.861936
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	12143.961496
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	11541.787685
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	12238.814645
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	12636.419929
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	10301.730612
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	9670.831348
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	12158.488344
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	9036.087223
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	11424.543861
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	13300.727750
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	13762.450777
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	13639.427026
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	11119.613827
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	6448.043121
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	9599.278322
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	15279.223249
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	11033.011563
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	7535.554311
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	1324.024462
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	5732.305825
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	8973.932540
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	16748.438031
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	13252.466007
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	16460.392805
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	10645.052812
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	13772.106903
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	12711.778579
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	24731.417805
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	14621.315982
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	9559.316587
SOS but now it comes out EOS	10312.588461
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	17202.308282
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	11604.586172
SOS mr EOS	24477.044567
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	10046.952782
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	8392.078872
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	16307.686118
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	14773.858596
SOS it is admirable EOS	28143.263785
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	12032.776448
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	7280.829386
SOS are you not diverted EOS	4776.789770
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS yes EOS	600.345924
SOS pray read on EOS	5478.330163
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	12769.067273
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	15883.105146
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	19544.597414
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	13807.522292
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	17205.085734
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	16940.449219
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	14715.786627
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	12851.923888
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	6523.500575
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	5803.817921
SOS for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn EOS	19406.655193
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	3711.998353
SOS but it is so strange EOS	4390.429268
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	8856.457536
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	9924.243489
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	8727.467003
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	15178.944007
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	16100.541136
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	14741.236884
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	10919.362635
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	6766.565625
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	18115.179816
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	8997.464751
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	14421.446327
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	16021.152278
SOS it was agreed to EOS	19376.406688
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	7308.697406
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	13020.445661
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	10199.411632
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	14948.592301
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	14882.371005
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	12946.766427
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	15473.012347
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	12610.730113
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	6927.925922
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	14339.605566
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	5243.982202
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	2306.473327
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	8617.061612
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	9624.323343
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	12933.221478
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	13921.099796
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	19904.462612
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	7977.948456
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	6625.428544
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	5508.339725
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	14289.197026
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	15723.568168
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	17884.142734
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	13580.436903
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	12994.182065
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	8124.493357
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	7433.171412
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	15942.543302
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	25053.105027
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	17915.095004
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	14477.316316
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	17253.327897
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	16517.813503
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	7316.169592
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	15777.779546
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	28143.263785
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	6257.872512
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	16608.030786
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	21188.372660
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	7885.472140
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	11158.874827
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	6653.919044
SOS those were your words EOS	13078.307909
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	11608.864540
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	12300.308362
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	4678.887800
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	5402.808714
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	6539.134726

SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	16738.625877
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	12526.860790
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	15451.246739
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	25642.722910

SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	15703.391719
SOS from the former EOS	1584.771799
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	17664.861951
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	16176.400121
SOS it did EOS	26863.914738
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	12031.882001
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	19551.058591
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	15526.312268
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	10004.213010
SOS he was angry EOS	7418.930870
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	13231.834122
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	10692.723162
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	14224.924213
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	11968.190584

SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	5411.834501
SOS was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table EOS	5143.201130
SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	11016.632108
SOS she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth EOS	12861.238250
SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	13956.844028
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	21458.931879
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	11713.077238
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	17685.320650
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	8100.084886

SOS very very much EOS	3950.195169

SOS but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley EOS	11047.360844
SOS another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment EOS	13247.804905
SOS when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish EOS	11241.956502
SOS now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself EOS	6086.391843
SOS i always had a value for him EOS	10990.336548
SOS were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me EOS	14419.837155

SOS how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton EOS	11410.362032
SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	14267.778734
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	25248.122337
SOS she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend EOS	7421.051849
SOS but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage EOS	12244.130873
SOS all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation EOS	14088.237209

SOS what shall we do with him EOS	15867.182679
SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	7759.669100
SOS elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet EOS	14742.112374
SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	13659.007057
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	10651.818064

SOS it may do very well for the others replied TITLE bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty EOS	7561.068910
SOS wont it kitty EOS	24477.044567
SOS kitty owned that she had rather stay at home EOS	6011.743664
SOS darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented EOS	13525.335079
SOS as she went up stairs to get ready TITLE bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself EOS	11576.654745

SOS so do not put yourself to inconvenience EOS	14544.860134
SOS during their walk it was resolved that TITLE bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening EOS	7226.372593

SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	13252.841490
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	15641.927112
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	11924.792054
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	13897.267707
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	8908.994445
SOS she was gone directly EOS	5899.708246
SOS her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious EOS	11804.006105

SOS are you out of your senses to be accepting this man EOS	12390.327646
SOS have not you always hated him EOS	13947.938783
SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	14322.480111
SOS it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to TITLE darcy EOS	10795.755842
SOS or in other words you are determined to have him EOS	6840.836974
SOS he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane EOS	9915.033209

SOS have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference EOS	11054.256898
SOS none at all EOS	4980.178159
SOS we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him EOS	11607.784450

SOS i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him EOS	16899.622224
SOS but let me advise you to think better of it EOS	7792.796050
SOS i know your disposition lizzy EOS	11958.778259
SOS i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior EOS	16088.031070

SOS my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life EOS	15595.858231
SOS you know not what you are about EOS	2955.591747
SOS elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that TITLE darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match EOS	14906.953279
SOS well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say EOS	3719.515401
SOS if this be the case he deserves you EOS	15022.363474

SOS he heard her with astonishment EOS	14421.173447
SOS this is an evening of wonders indeed EOS	11858.975038
SOS and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission EOS	18496.446581
SOS so much the better EOS	868.861763
SOS it will save me a world of trouble and economy EOS	18882.058104
SOS had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way EOS	14646.977881
SOS i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter EOS	10628.929030
SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	16203.364555
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	11150.288496
SOS every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time EOS	11571.121753
SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	9486.130933
SOS its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it TITLE bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable EOS	17712.418231
SOS nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them EOS	11057.642035
SOS she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself EOS	22918.360150

SOS but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for TITLE bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion EOS	13371.995765

SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	13891.144566
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	9197.657146
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	15907.240635

SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	15479.781484
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	4150.719238

SOS he has more to give EOS	8265.398033
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	4162.211925
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	8249.353878
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	12901.222883
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	15963.200409
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	19120.723611
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	12078.730542
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	15932.441535
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	13025.675098
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	13355.810592
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	7818.952978
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	11088.803969
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	13437.400424
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	10548.237592
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	6170.727111
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	14817.254453
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	13782.928621
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	14002.301585
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	19341.990564
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	10040.519153
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	10612.778885
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	10598.642972
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	20723.169841
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	7740.664223
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	13687.964838
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	12733.140124
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	9117.756668
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	13189.704897
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	13954.767693
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	11564.435213
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	11010.990746
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	13338.582923
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	9328.487266
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	11358.454603
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	18527.560545
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	5977.226839
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	6208.336624
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	7021.674539
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	11658.759803

SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	13223.783484
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	10368.620144
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	16991.189254
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	14474.819339
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	11693.502880
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	12093.461201
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	16880.557278
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	15073.823601
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	15511.595024
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	18047.247681
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	6684.368621
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	12497.168302
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	19368.202383
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	15036.405929
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	13080.344307
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	10224.395761
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	12195.019855
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	8016.919690
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	11972.063631
