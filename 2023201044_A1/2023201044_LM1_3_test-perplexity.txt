SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	4012.976188

SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	3233.720517
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	2120.536606
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	2082.864944
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	2664.126858
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	3900.350129
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	3011.515903
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	3265.639600
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	6706.083183
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	4141.783543
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	3293.385288
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	1746.758097
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	2001.781720
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	2876.932264
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	5161.558687
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	3085.813209
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	2873.215016
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	2293.489237
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	2886.280214
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	3936.127187

SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	4133.227037
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	2858.872673
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	878.293196
SOS not as you represent it EOS	9139.786211
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	3353.825536
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	3692.871057
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	1950.778046
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	4195.784121
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	3866.095514

SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	2723.951084
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	1412.470586
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	2012.331552
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	1815.088209
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	6351.712186
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	2604.192235
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	3669.680399
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	1929.261030
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	8535.883821
SOS it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled EOS	1613.251445

SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	1906.878866
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	1710.909458
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	2498.657145
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	3314.970865

SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	3080.248939
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	2916.497761
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	4084.683482
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	2277.348566
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	3497.177699

SOS the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study EOS	5430.439804
SOS in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society EOS	4573.925698
SOS but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever EOS	3024.662179
SOS yes indeed cried TITLE bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood EOS	3817.024715
SOS i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town EOS	2369.711996
SOS every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away EOS	1934.276064
SOS TITLE bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph EOS	3343.412569
SOS i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places EOS	4336.459325
SOS the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it TITLE bingley EOS	3565.953889
SOS when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same EOS	1554.328366
SOS they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either EOS	4386.920556
SOS aye that is because you have the right disposition EOS	1626.656144
SOS but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all EOS	2524.595564
SOS indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother EOS	3370.298547
SOS you quite mistook TITLE darcy EOS	3773.552364
SOS he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true EOS	2812.480318
SOS certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger EOS	3896.824536
SOS i know we dine with four and twenty families EOS	5307.150490
SOS nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance EOS	5876.811707
SOS his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards TITLE darcy with a very expressive smile EOS	2958.036346
SOS elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away EOS	2301.469858
SOS yes she called yesterday with her father EOS	4187.968925
SOS what an agreeable man sir william is TITLE bingley is not he EOS	4288.256097
SOS so much the man of fashion EOS	2860.889340
SOS so genteel and so easy EOS	9139.786211
SOS he has always something to say to every body EOS	2326.305708
SOS that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter EOS	4952.272964
SOS did charlotte dine with you EOS	5176.382367
SOS no she would go home EOS	6278.423948
SOS i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies EOS	6573.600323
SOS for my part TITLE bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently EOS	5102.638321
SOS but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you EOS	1424.529213
SOS it is a pity they are not handsome EOS	1780.981319
SOS not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend EOS	2808.358358
SOS she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley EOS	3580.751384
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS dear yes but you must own she is very plain EOS	4244.521341
SOS lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty EOS	6099.769469
SOS i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking EOS	1617.211156
SOS it is what every body says EOS	2097.860082
SOS i do not trust my own partiality EOS	2544.356536
SOS when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away EOS	1414.010749
SOS but however he did not EOS	906.257516
SOS perhaps he thought her too young EOS	6994.086391
SOS however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were EOS	4387.280896
SOS and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently EOS	5498.123040
SOS there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way EOS	2906.569759
SOS i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love EOS	5824.292685
SOS i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy EOS	2896.742467
SOS of a fine stout healthy love it may EOS	7792.289989
SOS every thing nourishes what is strong already EOS	6071.629636
SOS but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away EOS	3229.981707
SOS darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again EOS	4810.069904
SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	1885.433213
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	4739.834374
SOS she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but TITLE bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage EOS	4212.929327
SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	3461.795261
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	1704.160381
SOS lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age EOS	5000.661314
SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	4145.810827
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	1331.223511
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	4355.689338
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	1925.989932
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	1747.864147
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	10057.698109
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	4436.708230
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	2302.811594
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	2022.260089
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	1682.517953
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	3281.500707
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	1545.046661
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	2487.031856
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	2945.192006
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	3992.246959
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	4580.566338
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	4434.696433
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	5981.178281
SOS he made no answer EOS	472.689977
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	10057.698109
SOS you are mistaken EOS	746.417277
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	7629.276342
SOS how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year EOS	1904.125116
SOS letters of business too EOS	5664.000000
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	5915.982174
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	2773.196035
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	1593.197862
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	3895.947835
SOS i am afraid you do not like your pen EOS	811.382382
SOS let me mend it for you EOS	3090.583282
SOS i mend pens remarkably well EOS	9139.786211
SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	3230.744643
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	3572.234437
SOS he was silent EOS	1262.446338
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	2905.920419
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	1965.096924
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	3026.648760
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	2598.124694
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	2090.235848
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	2988.613316
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	2024.736069
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	3853.608010
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	2489.994542
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	4363.352375
SOS do not you darcy EOS	2283.459796
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	5386.607366
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	5549.295979
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	6118.092279
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	3614.088601
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	5750.001127
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	5525.265771
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	4892.513812
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	4761.813314
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	4723.643856
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	3577.930204
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	3375.629525
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	3127.390823
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	2256.104671
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	4298.081168
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	1489.062724
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	5447.691616
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	1517.326648
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	3021.013782
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	4224.075317
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	1989.246226
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	5139.039086
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	4040.805660
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	2666.912323
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	3958.970826
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	4627.717669
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	6036.562075
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	2816.910483
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	5247.915735
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	2050.686651
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	3565.735418
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	3850.258021
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	3707.462160
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	3352.796505
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	2687.997584
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	3726.974532
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	2475.855232
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	4190.509353
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	3905.499345
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	7547.635530
SOS perhaps i do EOS	3897.069699
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	2951.108647
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	2533.165883
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	2951.335650
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	2412.649939
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	3285.443832
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	4713.959163
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	1875.469903
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	2111.009808
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	2424.279250
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	8535.883821
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	5611.851131
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	3242.462124
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	1797.210912
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	7353.188122
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	1721.280694
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	4651.353955
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	2613.915271
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	2689.396512
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	3153.940425
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	3060.669178
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	2792.034696
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	5292.932863
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	2217.318068
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	3852.273508
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	3007.397853
SOS oh EOS	2499.311318
SOS yes EOS	9475.752486
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	2260.428852
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	5144.027250
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	4318.915188
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	3577.611474
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	3990.810759
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	1828.744168
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	1986.458974
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	3407.328734
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	3333.369831
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	9139.786211
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	5260.097951
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	2112.944838
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	2382.601707
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	5149.379501
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	7547.635530
SOS good bye EOS	2771.887717
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	2002.577339
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	2008.047119
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	2143.741501
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	8535.883821
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	3996.054931
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	1291.492171
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	2450.802609
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	3031.021942
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	4923.580543
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	1927.456657
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	1398.869362
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	3341.761504
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	3272.155498
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	4202.020918
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	3339.750349
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	3386.857044
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	3751.968401
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	2410.830147
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	2940.040322
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	3133.982844
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	3082.177700
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	4212.076721
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	1710.072417
SOS no one made any reply EOS	3385.218052
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	3318.567567
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	3430.067538
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	3972.627128
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	3219.081042
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	4230.048252
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	2175.868986
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	777.980925
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	4155.066988
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	3547.327068
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	1701.611141

SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	3102.799924
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	4057.909604
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	3055.790550
SOS what could he mean EOS	6954.913166
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	2939.529226
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	2131.959636
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	3265.489941
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	810.613324
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	4529.801678

SOS the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke EOS	4004.409161
SOS certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them EOS	1665.389415

SOS follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can EOS	3650.498365
SOS but these i suppose are precisely what you are without EOS	4621.908729
SOS perhaps that is not possible for any one EOS	3507.207881
SOS but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule EOS	3893.483706
SOS such as vanity and pride EOS	7050.740286
SOS yes vanity is a weakness indeed EOS	8535.883821
SOS but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation EOS	3811.671652
SOS elizabeth turned away to hide a smile EOS	8109.290138
SOS your examination of TITLE darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result EOS	1437.374644

SOS i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself EOS	3537.526333
SOS my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them EOS	2138.651266
SOS my temper would perhaps be called resentful EOS	8109.290138
SOS my good opinion once lost is lost for ever EOS	1941.535792
SOS that is a failing indeed EOS	3533.516553
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	660.484655
SOS implacable resentment is a shade in a character EOS	4605.661570
SOS but you have chosen your fault well EOS	4079.695229
SOS i really cannot laugh at it EOS	4824.581284
SOS you are safe from me EOS	2596.124150
SOS there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome EOS	4514.571343
SOS and your defect is a propensity to hate every body EOS	4390.326543

SOS do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share EOS	3133.186155
SOS louisa you will not mind my waking TITLE hurst EOS	3455.683525

SOS in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day EOS	1428.733293
SOS but TITLE bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before EOS	3759.232247
SOS her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home EOS	4690.935175
SOS TITLE bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if TITLE bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well EOS	2557.125244
SOS against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow TITLE bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made EOS	3661.943612
SOS the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred EOS	4699.166415
SOS miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other EOS	2414.621203
SOS the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right EOS	1288.990406

SOS she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself EOS	2528.924236
SOS he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it EOS	3297.335630
SOS steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her EOS	1901.371893
SOS on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place EOS	4581.554759
