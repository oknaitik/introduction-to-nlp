SOS the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic EOS	28.777298
SOS bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful EOS	5.529035
SOS darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure EOS	6.870867
SOS miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much EOS	5.453789
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of EOS	37.216234
SOS miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose EOS	5.598940
SOS within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate EOS	13.509739
SOS sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty EOS	5.408672
SOS the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly EOS	4.637634
SOS it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world EOS	10.213038
SOS for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body EOS	16.580132
SOS by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st EOS	66.821504
SOS james s had made him courteous EOS	41.832032
SOS lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to TITLE bennet EOS	45.137968
SOS they had several children EOS	8.963297
SOS the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend EOS	2.667262
SOS that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate EOS	22.247599
SOS you began the evening well charlotte said TITLE bennet with civil self command to miss lucas EOS	6.022460
SOS you were TITLE bingley s first choice EOS	11.484687
SOS yes but he seemed to like his second better EOS	13.324183
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice EOS	1.941396
SOS to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about TITLE robinson EOS	12.330025
SOS perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and TITLE robinson did not i mention it to you EOS	16.641695
SOS TITLE robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest EOS	12.559778
SOS and his answering immediately to the last question oh EOS	63.699867
SOS the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point EOS	28.837486
SOS upon my word EOS	3150.750985
SOS well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know EOS	3.935251
SOS my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte EOS	12.805070
SOS TITLE darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he EOS	30.725529
SOS poor eliza EOS	11.381679
SOS to be only just tolerable EOS	9.379945
SOS i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him EOS	14.645928
SOS TITLE long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips EOS	85.003599
SOS are you quite sure ma am EOS	374.906364
SOS is not there a little mistake EOS	31.961745
SOS said jane EOS	2715.983138
SOS i certainly saw TITLE darcy speaking to her EOS	155.978612
SOS aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to EOS	5.199374
SOS miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance EOS	6.897752
SOS with them he is remarkably agreeable EOS	2.969581
SOS i do not believe a word of it my dear EOS	421.115774
SOS if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to TITLE long EOS	145.429898
SOS but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that TITLE long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise EOS	8.431444
SOS i do not mind his not talking to TITLE long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza EOS	8.595081
SOS another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you EOS	67.792113
SOS i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him EOS	39.252111
SOS his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it EOS	20.536114
SOS one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself EOS	14.290783
SOS if i may so express it he has a right to be proud EOS	14.945200
SOS that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine EOS	32.520296
SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	3.072192
SOS by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary EOS	29.099075
SOS vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously EOS	1.534033
SOS a person may be proud without being vain EOS	2.435128
SOS pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us EOS	6.054955
SOS if i were as rich as TITLE darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was EOS	10.018070
SOS i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day EOS	6.476351
SOS then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said TITLE bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly EOS	27.894724
SOS the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit EOS	9.267946
SOS the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield EOS	18.833715
SOS the visit was returned in due form EOS	17.853351
SOS miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of TITLE hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest EOS	9.479424
SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	11.934152
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	13.850916
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	260.828668
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	12.916335
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	5.972758
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	13.731207
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	10.126616
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	2.755478
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	5.398882
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	13.527863
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	41.302555
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	60.465851
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	37.320670
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	14.065421
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	11.176440
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	30.255142
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	17.979750
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	6.334121
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	21.966762
SOS as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness EOS	3.504629
SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	29.806413
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	17.503726
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	110.165865
SOS not as you represent it EOS	3.339084
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	6.058146
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	4.398113
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	27.460860
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	3.007285
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	7.686324
SOS they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life EOS	10.988128
SOS you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound EOS	5.148546
SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	16.299970
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	23.118054
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	8.841784
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	31.260333
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	5.873905
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	10.487083
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	11.083305
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	86.602964
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	6.361672
SOS it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled EOS	30.275612
SOS what does TITLE darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster EOS	12.158848
SOS that is a question which TITLE darcy only can answer EOS	274.537766
SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	55.138533
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	23.782200
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	13.199825
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	8.213711
SOS you are severe on us EOS	5.388255
SOS it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas EOS	17.204410
SOS i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows EOS	17.020582
SOS you are a very strange creature by way of a friend EOS	11.767880
SOS always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body EOS	8.008230
SOS if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers EOS	13.862009
SOS on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must EOS	34.223410
SOS and gravely glancing at TITLE darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song EOS	3.531523
SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	17.767892
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	9.166541
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	5.851598
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	12.812241
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	4.725505
SOS what a charming amusement for young people this is TITLE darcy EOS	18.932133
SOS there is nothing like dancing after all EOS	26.477533
SOS i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies EOS	25.502513
SOS certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world EOS	5.832446
SOS every savage can dance EOS	4.315025
SOS sir william only smiled EOS	17.966267
SOS your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself TITLE darcy EOS	10.869678
SOS you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir EOS	2.035026
SOS yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight EOS	5.313522
SOS do you often dance at st EOS	16.299198
SOS james s EOS	1930.979207
SOS never sir EOS	12.797580
SOS do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place EOS	72.028669
SOS it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it EOS	10.996997
SOS you have a house in town i conclude EOS	229.096686
SOS TITLE darcy bowed EOS	55.507648
SOS i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas EOS	5.834758
SOS he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing EOS	15.975374
SOS TITLE darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner EOS	148.762920
SOS you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you EOS	6.777782
SOS and taking her hand he would have given it to TITLE darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing EOS	12.579880
SOS i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner EOS	15.956192
SOS TITLE darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain EOS	19.965905
SOS elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion EOS	5.864623
SOS you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour EOS	12.973665
SOS TITLE darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling EOS	14.306377
SOS he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner EOS	20.510165
SOS elizabeth looked archly and turned away EOS	64.561390
SOS her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie EOS	6.590667
SOS i should imagine not EOS	30.385421
SOS you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion EOS	5.437479
SOS i was never more annoyed EOS	348.754479
SOS the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people EOS	4.566269

SOS your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you EOS	9.901825
SOS my mind was more agreeably engaged EOS	6.361672
SOS i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow EOS	8.103592

SOS and pray when am i to wish you joy EOS	131.314962

SOS the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way EOS	5.665920
SOS the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt EOS	4.997799
SOS at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters EOS	3.886643
SOS their visits to TITLE philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence EOS	6.760062

SOS TITLE philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before EOS	12.158848
SOS they could talk of nothing but officers and TITLE bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign EOS	8.281848
SOS after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject TITLE bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country EOS	10.058181

SOS catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london EOS	47.212692

SOS when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do EOS	11.142440

SOS she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise EOS	5.880399
SOS that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to TITLE hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it EOS	17.808555
SOS she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness EOS	14.109833
SOS TITLE darcy said very little and TITLE hurst nothing at all EOS	29.828972
SOS the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone EOS	6.296677
SOS the latter was thinking only of his breakfast EOS	32.882019
SOS her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered EOS	22.034737

SOS elizabeth silently attended her EOS	11.237400

SOS the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts EOS	15.596881

SOS elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere EOS	6.411379
SOS when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so EOS	10.894515
SOS miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present EOS	20.383314

SOS their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency EOS	16.124417
SOS his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others EOS	6.037641
SOS she had very little notice from any but him EOS	45.129110
SOS miss bingley was engrossed by TITLE darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for TITLE hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her EOS	12.114291
SOS when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room EOS	34.002454
SOS her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty EOS	10.015708

SOS your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me EOS	10.792039
SOS i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning EOS	78.253282
SOS her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice EOS	17.853351
SOS you observed it TITLE darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition EOS	93.295161
SOS certainly not EOS	17.103584
SOS to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone EOS	4.081893

SOS i am afraid TITLE darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes EOS	10.660438
SOS not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise EOS	16.230072

SOS yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside EOS	4.255129
SOS that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily EOS	20.269440
SOS if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable EOS	19.560487
SOS but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy EOS	8.764326
SOS to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations EOS	4.251446
SOS with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee EOS	13.883526
SOS she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself EOS	17.318733
SOS on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book EOS	4.807783

SOS in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well EOS	20.847544
SOS elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying EOS	10.903693

SOS charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley EOS	2.254263
SOS i wish it may EOS	41.595204
SOS but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model EOS	17.114719

SOS upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation EOS	6.978338
SOS elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between TITLE bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game EOS	9.451236

SOS i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished EOS	16.624917
SOS your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth EOS	7.343071
SOS the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen EOS	3.341746
SOS but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general EOS	10.827911
SOS i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished EOS	18.197802
SOS nor i i am sure said miss bingley EOS	26.324183

SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with EOS	4.521689
SOS a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved EOS	3.864774
SOS all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading EOS	9.001508
SOS i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women EOS	14.941401

SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when TITLE hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward EOS	6.468811
SOS as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room EOS	13.557919
SOS eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds EOS	14.493129
SOS but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art EOS	14.239969
SOS undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation EOS	2.939832
SOS whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable EOS	3.558439
SOS miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject EOS	28.435448

SOS bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable EOS	6.924981
SOS they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister EOS	2.892258
SOS elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from TITLE bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters EOS	15.119813
SOS in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation EOS	5.560765

SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	30.411234
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	6.663767
SOS she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but TITLE bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage EOS	4.475853
SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	25.374544
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	36.193260
SOS lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age EOS	3.719027
SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	7.013093
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	27.952551
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	24.850187
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	32.904685
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	53.882540
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	4.380608
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	4.512953
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	41.084750
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	24.251592
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	21.803210
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	80.962096
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	27.321911
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	35.538821
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	10.842501
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	26.721150
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	9.885228
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	5.133955
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	4.663774
SOS he made no answer EOS	3688.800868
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	2.699636
SOS you are mistaken EOS	610.710127
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	77.848578
SOS how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year EOS	29.190837
SOS letters of business too EOS	1.534033
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	8.063818
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	21.027069
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	121.008210
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	11.350275
SOS i am afraid you do not like your pen EOS	150.234952
SOS let me mend it for you EOS	16.289612
SOS i mend pens remarkably well EOS	8.063570
SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	44.937741
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	10.879765
SOS he was silent EOS	4818.020793
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	9.269462
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	40.725331
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	14.466962
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	159.487062
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	205.578525
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	27.930719
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	35.415942
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	8.204316
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	24.643846
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	8.139357
SOS do not you darcy EOS	56.670823
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	10.928052
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	4.013080
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	7.813614
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	6.408808
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	6.103891
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	3.953911
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	7.097240
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	10.826840
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	3.252709
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	8.100420
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	6.780580
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	15.191274
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	78.268086
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	10.465721
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	59.339256
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	2.262550
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	46.735364
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	12.650838
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	8.459019
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	22.581244
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	4.597176
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	6.151689
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	11.678215
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	3.282532
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	10.464895
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	3.886100
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	11.618665
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	2.540790
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	25.021478
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	13.494097
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	5.047460
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	3.597307
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	7.925267
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	10.444385
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	3.796413
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	15.427420
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	5.706115
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	19.606532
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	2.035026
SOS perhaps i do EOS	303.372419
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	6.112974
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	13.576533
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	14.581704
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	79.217419
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	16.827388
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	4.369559
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	15.384125
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	18.817971
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	11.373419
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	6.361672
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	22.034737
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	6.162231
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	35.614813
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	3.792624
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	33.917113
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	3.103849
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	10.559395
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	24.150743
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	6.035174
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	20.378038
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	10.991101
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	4.954901
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	16.931877
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	5.173296
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	13.800841
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS yes EOS	600.345924
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	16.901547
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	4.037637
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	5.085995
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	10.856879
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	7.101738
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	42.797660
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	14.893819
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	6.392766
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	8.069398
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	8.063570
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	3.405432
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	130.310113
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	27.222214
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	3.043982
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	4.151933
SOS good bye EOS	5742.231089
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	30.771528
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	58.549023
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	12.527915
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	2.935384
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	7.053115
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	312.102329
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	17.280340
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	14.888620
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	9.491985
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	28.598661
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	213.504412
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	24.850187
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	14.321217
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	5.255987
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	10.588762
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	11.183379
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	5.296917
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	10.759818
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	6.997509
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	9.662069
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	15.090662
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	11.887063
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	32.858401
SOS no one made any reply EOS	34.455348
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	6.062987
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	12.678058
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	5.714934
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	10.889596
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	7.010466
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	20.639974
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	40.091205
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	8.459670
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	5.391337
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	68.018446
SOS elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately EOS	465.906686
SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	6.283029
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	9.441502
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	7.214217
SOS what could he mean EOS	55.115349
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	16.096357
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	11.719768
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	16.514566
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	104.149644
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	2.708814
SOS oh EOS	1715.343569
SOS shocking EOS	1.534033
SOS cried miss bingley EOS	31.142524

SOS TITLE darcy may hug himself EOS	63.146955
SOS TITLE darcy is not to be laughed at EOS	126.246524

SOS that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance EOS	59.470354
SOS i dearly love a laugh EOS	8.063570
SOS miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be EOS	25.596407
SOS the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke EOS	10.074296

SOS i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good EOS	6.322083
SOS follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can EOS	4.037637
SOS but these i suppose are precisely what you are without EOS	18.833715
SOS perhaps that is not possible for any one EOS	14.044090

SOS such as vanity and pride EOS	18.705546
SOS yes vanity is a weakness indeed EOS	2.711925
SOS but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation EOS	5.967377
SOS elizabeth turned away to hide a smile EOS	5.325424

SOS you are safe from me EOS	20.274665

SOS in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day EOS	38.871989
