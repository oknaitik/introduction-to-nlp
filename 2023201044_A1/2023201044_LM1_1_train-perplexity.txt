SOS jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail EOS	294.516412

SOS it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said TITLE bennet and nothing can clear TITLE collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn EOS	445.334587

SOS as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch EOS	712.091401

SOS TITLE wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker EOS	580.451645

SOS when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence EOS	463.620048
SOS elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to TITLE darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it EOS	476.824318
SOS they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance EOS	467.845352
SOS he replied and was again silent EOS	166.997847
SOS after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now TITLE darcy EOS	341.652847
SOS i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples EOS	394.455115

SOS very well EOS	98.280306
SOS that reply will do for the present EOS	182.339317

SOS sometimes EOS	122.534483
SOS one must speak a little you know EOS	203.980794
SOS it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible EOS	398.698512
SOS are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine EOS	497.431413
SOS both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds EOS	569.470361
SOS we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb EOS	809.682759
SOS this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he EOS	362.049147

SOS you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly EOS	631.907537
SOS i must not decide on my own performance EOS	357.926007
SOS he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton EOS	332.617003
SOS she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance EOS	530.376048
SOS the effect was immediate EOS	201.174009
SOS a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on EOS	585.255855
SOS at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said TITLE wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain EOS	679.811257
SOS he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life EOS	385.873048
SOS darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject EOS	411.907149
SOS at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving TITLE darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner EOS	520.130114

SOS such very superior dancing is not often seen EOS	427.573458

SOS recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of EOS	604.712429
SOS i do not think we were speaking at all EOS	194.158052
SOS sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves EOS	369.441973
SOS we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine EOS	550.884764
SOS what think you of books EOS	175.053038
SOS said he smiling EOS	188.545844

SOS no EOS	51.546248

SOS said he with a look of doubt EOS	157.139851
SOS yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say TITLE darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable EOS	738.569620

SOS and what is your success EOS	147.092712
SOS she shook her head EOS	216.258203
SOS i do not get on at all EOS	142.458100
SOS i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly EOS	485.743366
SOS i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either EOS	522.348712
SOS but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity EOS	361.421096
SOS i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied EOS	630.717261
SOS she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another EOS	600.457044
SOS they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham EOS	654.766620
SOS your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late TITLE darcy s steward EOS	402.390382
SOS let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to TITLE darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated TITLE darcy in a most infamous manner EOS	525.019305
SOS i do not know the particulars but i know very well that TITLE darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way EOS	321.180255
SOS his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it EOS	343.042193
SOS i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better EOS	668.275554
SOS his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of TITLE darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself EOS	374.967692
SOS i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer EOS	685.984606

SOS i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of TITLE darcy EOS	291.086850
SOS she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley EOS	468.097701
SOS jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening EOS	530.848535
SOS elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness EOS	503.770662
SOS i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about TITLE wickham EOS	308.046766
SOS but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon EOS	394.488055
SOS no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you EOS	251.843357
SOS TITLE bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended TITLE darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that TITLE wickham has deserved much less attention from TITLE darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s TITLE wickham is by no means a respectable young man EOS	392.955273
SOS i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose TITLE darcy s regard EOS	377.895625
SOS TITLE bingley does not know TITLE wickham himself EOS	226.277610
SOS no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton EOS	276.073974
SOS this account then is what he has received from TITLE darcy EOS	260.253008
SOS i am perfectly satisfied EOS	231.843516
SOS but what does he say of the living EOS	166.147791
SOS he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from TITLE darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only EOS	420.334362
SOS i have not a doubt of TITLE bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only EOS	379.668929
SOS TITLE bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before EOS	442.964383
SOS she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment EOS	353.902224
SOS elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it EOS	419.354471
SOS on their being joined by TITLE bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before TITLE collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery EOS	484.040238
SOS i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness EOS	380.472639
SOS i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine EOS	417.867662
SOS how wonderfully these sort of things occur EOS	1021.714883
SOS who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly EOS	424.072229
SOS i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before EOS	335.560316
SOS my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology EOS	731.584682
SOS you are not going to introduce yourself to TITLE darcy EOS	215.210629
SOS indeed i am EOS	120.612510
SOS i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier EOS	471.022076
SOS i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew EOS	199.679431
SOS it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se night EOS	383.584632
SOS elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that TITLE darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to TITLE darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance EOS	483.644636
SOS TITLE collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained EOS	710.064362
SOS you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty EOS	488.234919
SOS pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself EOS	819.886821
SOS and with a low bow he left her to attack TITLE darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident EOS	588.879080
SOS her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh EOS	465.795357
SOS it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man EOS	253.561228
SOS TITLE darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last TITLE collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility EOS	527.496941
SOS TITLE collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and TITLE darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way EOS	501.932386
SOS TITLE collins then returned to elizabeth EOS	169.829721
SOS i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception EOS	263.020239
SOS TITLE darcy seemed much pleased with the attention EOS	242.811835
SOS he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily EOS	445.085591
SOS it was really a very handsome thought EOS	202.352416
SOS upon the whole i am much pleased with him EOS	220.891144
SOS as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and TITLE bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane EOS	429.086338
SOS she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters EOS	428.031912
SOS her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much EOS	511.151779
SOS when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to TITLE bingley EOS	465.255993
SOS it was an animating subject and TITLE bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match EOS	526.991736
SOS his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do EOS	362.020752
SOS it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked EOS	441.549659
SOS it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than TITLE bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life EOS	418.135084
SOS she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it EOS	632.641684
SOS in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by TITLE darcy who sat opposite to them EOS	539.272802
SOS her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical EOS	476.613448
SOS what is TITLE darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him EOS	166.814500
SOS i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear EOS	340.273505
SOS for heaven s sake madam speak lower EOS	840.712396
SOS what advantage can it be to you to offend TITLE darcy EOS	202.916754
SOS you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing EOS	317.385751
SOS nothing that she could say however had any influence EOS	246.324035
SOS her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone EOS	372.089548
SOS elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation EOS	501.293212
SOS she could not help frequently glancing her eye at TITLE darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her EOS	402.555965
SOS the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity EOS	863.108454
SOS at length however TITLE bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken EOS	576.740848
SOS elizabeth now began to revive EOS	336.198771
SOS but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company EOS	508.220771
SOS by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song EOS	624.020863
SOS elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another EOS	591.361885
SOS mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected EOS	575.941360
SOS elizabeth was in agonies EOS	194.870926
SOS she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley EOS	298.721719
SOS she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave EOS	661.277091
SOS she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night EOS	635.486849
SOS he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child EOS	670.698461
SOS you have delighted us long enough EOS	320.314528
SOS let the other young ladies have time to exhibit EOS	367.615417
SOS mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good EOS	460.236638
SOS others of the party were now applied to EOS	213.192799
SOS if i said TITLE collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman EOS	493.771902
SOS i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to EOS	440.119276
SOS the rector of a parish has much to do EOS	236.826944
SOS in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron EOS	473.049776
SOS he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible EOS	477.233162
SOS and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment EOS	579.294929
SOS i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family EOS	523.075923
SOS and with a bow to TITLE darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room EOS	314.343039
SOS many stared EOS	380.371907
SOS many smiled but no one looked more amused than TITLE bennet himself while his wife seriously commended TITLE collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man EOS	696.545620
SOS to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed EOS	385.608486
SOS that his two sisters and TITLE darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable EOS	451.412161
SOS the rest of the evening brought her little amusement EOS	251.633662
SOS she was teazed by TITLE collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others EOS	389.890429
SOS in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room EOS	417.036446
SOS he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening EOS	331.663289
SOS there was no arguing upon such a project EOS	535.013514
SOS she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged TITLE collins s conversation to herself EOS	530.432382
SOS she was at least free from the offence of TITLE darcy s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak EOS	572.527318
SOS she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to TITLE wickham and rejoiced in it EOS	210.018519
SOS the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of TITLE bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family EOS	388.336481
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves EOS	586.315591
SOS they repulsed every attempt of TITLE bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of TITLE collins who was complimenting TITLE bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests EOS	544.601526
SOS darcy said nothing at all EOS	150.946555

SOS when at length they arose to take leave TITLE bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to TITLE bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation EOS	481.842411
SOS bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time EOS	487.945056
SOS TITLE bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months EOS	759.047318
SOS of having another daughter married to TITLE collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure EOS	432.004065

SOS having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business EOS	451.121487
SOS on finding TITLE bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning EOS	446.368044
SOS before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise TITLE bennet instantly answered oh dear EOS	392.272984
SOS yes certainly EOS	212.474597
SOS i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection EOS	304.114580
SOS come kitty i want you up stairs EOS	372.656674
SOS and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go EOS	614.407692
SOS i beg you will not go EOS	181.590787
SOS TITLE collins must excuse me EOS	237.387324
SOS he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear EOS	236.710133
SOS i am going away myself EOS	242.289449
SOS no no nonsense lizzy EOS	411.918541
SOS i desire you will stay where you are EOS	267.734077
SOS and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing TITLE collins EOS	704.841277
SOS elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion EOS	648.715815
SOS TITLE bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone TITLE collins began EOS	278.804271
SOS believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections EOS	691.131863
SOS you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address EOS	404.637979
SOS you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken EOS	707.580241
SOS almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life EOS	333.585759
SOS but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did EOS	466.927190
SOS the idea of TITLE collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish EOS	536.939491
SOS secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness EOS	504.307483
SOS twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too EOS	579.590425
SOS on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while TITLE jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s foot stool that she said TITLE collins you must marry EOS	716.378726
SOS a clergyman like you must marry EOS	338.804134
SOS chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way EOS	741.442095
SOS this is my advice EOS	187.560370
SOS find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her EOS	240.265596
SOS allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer EOS	422.335045
SOS you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite EOS	618.081682
SOS thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women EOS	674.491611
SOS but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years EOS	539.666263
SOS this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem EOS	457.807659
SOS and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection EOS	335.472769
SOS to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the NUM per cents EOS	522.585647
SOS which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to EOS	376.225535
SOS on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married EOS	712.719489
SOS it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now EOS	303.134653
SOS you are too hasty sir she cried EOS	378.141668
SOS you forget that i have made no answer EOS	218.170435
SOS let me do it without farther loss of time EOS	318.969755
SOS accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me EOS	454.440335
SOS i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them EOS	334.195704
SOS i am not now to learn replied TITLE collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time EOS	536.396354
SOS i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long EOS	469.698861
SOS upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration EOS	632.983153
SOS i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time EOS	421.242327
SOS i am perfectly serious in my refusal EOS	329.449973
SOS you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so EOS	213.397755
SOS nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation EOS	441.770189
SOS were it certain that lady catherine would think so said TITLE collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you EOS	352.243347
SOS and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications EOS	368.594978
SOS indeed TITLE collins all praise of me will be unnecessary EOS	317.737655
SOS you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say EOS	343.290814
SOS i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise EOS	394.114555
SOS in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach EOS	535.403297
SOS this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled EOS	601.244456
SOS and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not TITLE collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character EOS	455.818478
SOS really TITLE collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly EOS	559.468971
SOS if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one EOS	350.827354
SOS you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course EOS	500.059420
SOS my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable EOS	604.486428
SOS my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you EOS	479.330641
SOS your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications EOS	822.235833
SOS as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females EOS	545.770513
SOS i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man EOS	548.700982
SOS i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere EOS	386.022160
SOS i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible EOS	314.443389
SOS my feelings in every respect forbid it EOS	328.994520
SOS can i speak plainer EOS	403.261974
SOS do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart EOS	592.705421
SOS you are uniformly charming EOS	456.102703
SOS cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable EOS	675.570076
SOS to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female EOS	828.338840
SOS TITLE collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for TITLE bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection EOS	610.975683
SOS TITLE collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character EOS	660.345680
SOS this information however startled TITLE bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so EOS	443.855341
SOS but depend upon it TITLE collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason EOS	310.581600
SOS i will speak to her about it myself directly EOS	211.834727
SOS she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it EOS	302.240623
SOS pardon me for interrupting you madam cried TITLE collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state EOS	522.055555
SOS if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity EOS	733.543506
SOS sir you quite misunderstand me said TITLE bennet alarmed EOS	534.731664
SOS lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these EOS	446.438637
SOS in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived EOS	365.147688
SOS i will go directly to TITLE bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure EOS	251.258584
SOS she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh EOS	372.751869
SOS TITLE bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar EOS	404.609720
SOS you must come and make lizzy marry TITLE collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her EOS	273.860303
SOS TITLE bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication EOS	453.824868
SOS i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech EOS	208.317020
SOS of what are you talking EOS	133.148266
SOS of TITLE collins and lizzy EOS	97.655972

SOS it seems an hopeless business EOS	464.067104
SOS speak to lizzy about it yourself EOS	241.186824
SOS tell her that you insist upon her marrying him EOS	285.876184
SOS let her be called down EOS	223.214636
SOS she shall hear my opinion EOS	217.958341

SOS i have sent for you on an affair of importance EOS	244.747897
SOS i understand that TITLE collins has made you an offer of marriage EOS	265.386350
SOS is it true EOS	130.155551
SOS elizabeth replied that it was EOS	95.068402
SOS very well and this offer of marriage you have refused EOS	258.604760
SOS i have sir EOS	100.413782
SOS very well EOS	98.280306

SOS your mother will never see you again if you do not marry TITLE collins and i will never see you again if you do EOS	256.580731
SOS elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but TITLE bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed EOS	398.425033
SOS what do you mean TITLE bennet by talking in this way EOS	268.828321
SOS you promised me to insist upon her marrying him EOS	339.629065
SOS my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request EOS	479.356742

SOS i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be EOS	185.903031
SOS not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did TITLE bennet give up the point EOS	291.682994
SOS she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns EOS	434.867068
SOS she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks EOS	864.080525
SOS though her manner varied however her determination never did EOS	528.515913
SOS TITLE collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed EOS	532.509119
SOS he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way EOS	416.068987
SOS his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret EOS	438.250825
SOS while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them EOS	329.988977
SOS she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here EOS	412.045167
SOS what do you think has happened this morning EOS	299.724340
SOS TITLE collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him EOS	197.083527
SOS charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where TITLE bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family EOS	452.908773
SOS pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves EOS	928.849205
SOS charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth EOS	260.824668
SOS aye there she comes continued TITLE bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way EOS	597.438646
SOS but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead EOS	364.874266
SOS i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you EOS	197.182912
SOS i have done with you from this very day EOS	161.637168

SOS her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation EOS	634.007667
SOS she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by TITLE collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let TITLE collins and me have a little conversation together EOS	460.722177
SOS elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of TITLE collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear EOS	441.529679
SOS in a doleful voice TITLE bennet thus began the projected conversation EOS	691.293486
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS TITLE collins EOS	82.530439

SOS far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter EOS	410.317307
SOS resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned EOS	514.188130
SOS perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation EOS	715.721386
SOS you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and TITLE bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf EOS	669.075549
SOS my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own EOS	670.873790

SOS i have certainly meant well through the whole affair EOS	390.260104
SOS my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise EOS	541.579242
SOS the discussion of TITLE collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother EOS	527.989045
SOS as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence EOS	624.451537
SOS he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend EOS	347.579795
SOS the morrow produced no abatement of TITLE bennet s ill humour or ill health EOS	646.911429
SOS TITLE collins was also in the same state of angry pride EOS	318.598344
SOS elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it EOS	431.295909

SOS to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed EOS	407.524529
SOS i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet TITLE darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself EOS	351.058043
SOS she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her EOS	495.661453
SOS his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother EOS	365.245026
SOS soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately EOS	372.027041
SOS the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages EOS	1075.429048
SOS jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs EOS	544.682919
SOS when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal EOS	534.161570

SOS you shall hear what she says EOS	267.116644
SOS she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where TITLE hurst had a house EOS	607.847877
SOS the next was in these words EOS	184.611374
SOS i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence EOS	675.738582
SOS i depend on you for that EOS	117.970230
SOS to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent TITLE bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his EOS	398.600856
SOS it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country EOS	328.648416
SOS but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters EOS	571.595807

SOS many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair EOS	363.646940
SOS i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you EOS	703.461337
SOS it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter EOS	403.785842
SOS it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should EOS	302.651752

SOS jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart EOS	431.727878
SOS they agreed that TITLE bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together EOS	530.850677
SOS after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that TITLE bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses EOS	427.153353

SOS the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained EOS	860.204240

SOS elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation EOS	366.768824
SOS she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged TITLE collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family EOS	338.162335

SOS as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and TITLE bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them EOS	416.010400

SOS elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time TITLE bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them EOS	379.626591

SOS the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on TITLE darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked TITLE darcy before they had known any thing of the matter EOS	398.601263
SOS miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else TITLE darcy was condemned as the worst of men EOS	739.526453

SOS he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks EOS	567.635776
SOS on the following monday TITLE bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn EOS	361.289466

SOS TITLE gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation EOS	303.494514
SOS when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject EOS	289.591443
SOS it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she EOS	286.367566

SOS a young man such as you describe TITLE bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent EOS	745.226411
SOS an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us EOS	314.072462
SOS we do not suffer by accident EOS	375.778038
SOS it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before EOS	428.892445
SOS but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea EOS	652.536317
SOS it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment EOS	468.176906
SOS pray how violent was TITLE bingley s love EOS	356.839555
SOS i never saw a more promising inclination EOS	372.564717
SOS he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her EOS	523.511786

SOS elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence EOS	486.390008
SOS i hope added TITLE gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her EOS	342.732005
SOS we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her EOS	419.181344

SOS my dear aunt how could you think of it EOS	170.823737
SOS TITLE darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it TITLE bingley never stirs without him EOS	589.227297

SOS she will not be able to help calling EOS	216.218252
SOS she will drop the acquaintance entirely EOS	352.000772
SOS but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless EOS	428.157543
SOS it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions EOS	546.241884
SOS miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him EOS	392.303660
SOS the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement EOS	380.460697

SOS without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment EOS	378.022608
SOS to TITLE gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers EOS	524.126443
SOS about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged EOS	515.599185
SOS they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring EOS	384.725376
SOS TITLE gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late TITLE darcy by character perfectly well EOS	351.213741
SOS here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse EOS	699.745260
SOS in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself EOS	591.475549
SOS on being made acquainted with the present TITLE darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard TITLE fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy EOS	645.469156
SOS TITLE gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly EOS	595.200831
SOS seriously i would have you be on your guard EOS	236.113065

SOS she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side EOS	484.654147

SOS colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to TITLE collins sat for some time without speaking to any body EOS	630.755614
SOS at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family EOS	319.653692

SOS it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november TITLE darcy EOS	523.639910
SOS it must have been a most agreeable surprise to TITLE bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before EOS	274.151358
SOS he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london EOS	223.020710
SOS perfectly so i thank you EOS	200.871617
SOS she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that TITLE bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again EOS	331.415798
SOS i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future EOS	282.617429
SOS he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing EOS	377.259575
SOS if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there EOS	360.560716
SOS but perhaps TITLE bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle EOS	326.384836
SOS i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers EOS	381.809865
SOS elizabeth made no answer EOS	205.479542
SOS she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him EOS	282.412374
SOS he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house EOS	380.028141
SOS lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when TITLE collins first came to hunsford EOS	299.177572
SOS i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object EOS	274.259981
SOS TITLE collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife EOS	382.154230
SOS yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had EOS	447.243376
SOS my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying TITLE collins as the wisest thing she ever did EOS	390.048645
SOS she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her EOS	388.433009
SOS it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends EOS	250.010391
SOS an easy distance do you call it EOS	379.588832
SOS it is nearly fifty miles EOS	576.719830
SOS and what is fifty miles of good road EOS	354.526982
SOS little more than half a day s journey EOS	317.205574
SOS yes i call it a very easy distance EOS	350.608678
SOS i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth EOS	252.933624
SOS i should never have said TITLE collins was settled near her family EOS	241.277988
SOS it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire EOS	233.014570
SOS any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far EOS	385.225784
SOS as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family EOS	316.892234
SOS the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances EOS	445.523223
SOS where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil EOS	862.800229
SOS but that is not the case here EOS	139.442240
SOS TITLE and TITLE collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance EOS	454.237067
SOS TITLE darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment EOS	427.990667
SOS you cannot have been always at longbourn EOS	209.099908
SOS elizabeth looked surprised EOS	235.182091
SOS the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent EOS	760.443000
SOS a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk EOS	540.180046
SOS the tête à tête surprised them EOS	967.298341
SOS TITLE darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away EOS	624.347231
SOS what can be the meaning of this EOS	146.674703
SOS said charlotte as soon as he was gone EOS	176.068526
SOS my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way EOS	338.967278
SOS but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year EOS	383.592375
SOS all field sports were over EOS	873.173069
SOS within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day EOS	553.281898
SOS they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt EOS	635.537194
SOS it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind EOS	492.681388
SOS but why TITLE darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand EOS	280.303256
SOS it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself EOS	463.527246
SOS he seldom appeared really animated EOS	768.613762
SOS TITLE collins knew not what to make of him EOS	139.511086
SOS colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out EOS	394.064249
SOS she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success EOS	411.558463
SOS he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable EOS	337.303077
SOS it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind EOS	558.721226
SOS she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and TITLE collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power EOS	383.361148
SOS in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam EOS	522.820375
SOS he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages TITLE darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all EOS	545.729198
SOS more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet TITLE darcy EOS	544.476118
SOS she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers EOS	554.217857
SOS how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd EOS	482.096086
SOS yet it did and even a third EOS	242.916703
SOS it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her EOS	710.446179
SOS he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of TITLE and TITLE collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too EOS	444.754935
SOS his words seemed to imply it EOS	325.493135
SOS could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts EOS	229.627778
SOS she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter EOS	481.075982
SOS it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage EOS	326.406646
SOS she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by TITLE darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her EOS	529.532717
SOS putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way EOS	401.832782
SOS i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage EOS	355.645518
SOS are you going much farther EOS	257.219900
SOS no i should have turned in a moment EOS	173.155273
SOS and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together EOS	387.525791
SOS do you certainly leave kent on saturday EOS	477.843598
SOS said she EOS	61.333613
SOS yes if darcy does not put it off again EOS	355.436528
SOS but i am at his disposal EOS	194.572744
SOS he arranges the business just as he pleases EOS	501.081630
SOS and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice EOS	305.093959
SOS i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than TITLE darcy EOS	361.135789
SOS he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam EOS	356.792201
SOS but so we all do EOS	130.745632
SOS it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor EOS	384.625051
SOS i speak feelingly EOS	364.760241
SOS a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence EOS	607.662616
SOS in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either EOS	369.558152
SOS now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence EOS	499.241864
SOS when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for EOS	480.480711
SOS these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature EOS	515.636648
SOS but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money EOS	403.043074
SOS younger sons cannot marry where they like EOS	858.411425
SOS unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do EOS	424.118592
SOS our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money EOS	641.130766
SOS is this thought elizabeth meant for me EOS	214.493223
SOS and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son EOS	545.513163
SOS unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds EOS	816.664525
SOS he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped EOS	290.333292
SOS to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal EOS	519.000094
SOS i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind EOS	448.624442
SOS but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her EOS	296.509125
SOS no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me EOS	366.268202
SOS i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy EOS	203.627608
SOS are you indeed EOS	131.451430
SOS and pray what sort of guardians do you make EOS	356.976931
SOS does your charge give you much trouble EOS	457.987220
SOS young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way EOS	394.290538
SOS as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth EOS	473.959983
SOS she directly replied you need not be frightened EOS	349.988207
SOS i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world EOS	307.383975
SOS she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance TITLE hurst and miss bingley EOS	294.801123
SOS i think i have heard you say that you know them EOS	160.228774

SOS yes said elizabeth drily TITLE darcy is uncommonly kind to TITLE bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him EOS	497.474787
SOS care of him EOS	102.452781
SOS yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care EOS	612.501552
SOS from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him EOS	367.059242
SOS but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant EOS	275.651273
SOS it was all conjecture EOS	151.361202
SOS what is it you mean EOS	139.140036
SOS it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing EOS	308.234642
SOS you may depend upon my not mentioning it EOS	328.212526
SOS and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley EOS	186.303682
SOS what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer EOS	481.392915
SOS did TITLE darcy give you his reasons for this interference EOS	310.528382
SOS i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady EOS	384.585215
SOS and what arts did he use to separate them EOS	360.093521
SOS he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling EOS	347.363532
SOS he only told me what i have now told you EOS	204.213100
SOS elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation EOS	501.952152
SOS after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful EOS	436.511468
SOS i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she EOS	216.086099
SOS your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings EOS	474.439681
SOS why was he to be the judge EOS	132.790720
SOS you are rather disposed to call his interference officious EOS	593.788105
SOS i do not see what right TITLE darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy EOS	354.945561
SOS but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him EOS	357.518595
SOS it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case EOS	164.250071
SOS that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly EOS	610.003815
SOS this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of TITLE darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage EOS	558.488219
SOS there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard EOS	358.016716
SOS it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected EOS	274.597296
SOS there could not exist in the world two men over whom TITLE darcy could have such boundless influence EOS	569.203962
SOS that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate TITLE bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them EOS	362.153851
SOS if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer EOS	406.390543
SOS he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted EOS	493.614802
SOS there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london EOS	597.595549
SOS to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection EOS	304.885955
SOS all loveliness and goodness as she is EOS	246.828097
SOS her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating EOS	581.355572
SOS neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which TITLE darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach EOS	772.383956
SOS when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with TITLE darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining TITLE bingley for his sister EOS	504.272913
SOS the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see TITLE darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea EOS	519.714069
SOS TITLE collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but TITLE collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home EOS	470.881216
SOS when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against TITLE darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent EOS	412.123126
SOS they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering EOS	1268.133281
SOS but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded EOS	518.193332
SOS elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal EOS	603.304063
SOS TITLE darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings EOS	554.274063
SOS it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do EOS	304.102779
SOS she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him EOS	332.858549
SOS while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her EOS	567.199659
SOS but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw TITLE darcy walk into the room EOS	450.986720
SOS in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better EOS	502.577982
SOS she answered him with cold civility EOS	325.528606
SOS he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room EOS	490.816215
SOS elizabeth was surprised but said not a word EOS	177.557072

SOS you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you EOS	327.071832
SOS elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression EOS	321.184391
SOS she stared coloured doubted and was silent EOS	547.835373
SOS this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed EOS	386.539146
SOS he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride EOS	373.015180
SOS his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit EOS	602.174611
SOS in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger EOS	531.099078
SOS she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done EOS	380.890833
SOS he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand EOS	398.679784
SOS as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer EOS	248.880571
SOS he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security EOS	597.063678
SOS such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned EOS	639.001028
SOS it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you EOS	340.939199
SOS but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly EOS	412.316255
SOS i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one EOS	267.870842

SOS the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation EOS	509.491709
SOS TITLE darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise EOS	701.886547
SOS his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature EOS	706.710825
SOS he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it EOS	411.608670
SOS the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful EOS	206.366771
SOS at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting EOS	271.973306
SOS i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected EOS	516.016810
SOS but it is of small importance EOS	178.831466
SOS i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character EOS	524.017515
SOS was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil EOS	353.060508

SOS you know i have EOS	81.866668
SOS had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister EOS	461.628730

SOS she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse EOS	715.872774

SOS but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded EOS	371.499686
SOS long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided EOS	295.176080
SOS your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from TITLE wickham EOS	464.894940
SOS on this subject what can you have to say EOS	169.760655
SOS in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself EOS	756.588142
SOS or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others EOS	1028.651026
SOS you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour EOS	577.130630
SOS who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him EOS	441.286585
SOS his misfortunes EOS	185.514180
SOS repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed EOS	748.318135
SOS and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy EOS	350.478604
SOS you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty EOS	715.869265
SOS you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him EOS	282.519960
SOS you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert EOS	439.879172
SOS you have done all this EOS	130.007902
SOS and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule EOS	429.043934
SOS and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me EOS	383.187907
SOS this is the estimation in which you hold me EOS	245.323694
SOS i thank you for explaining it so fully EOS	387.990128
SOS my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed EOS	1045.368179
SOS but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design EOS	828.719137
SOS these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing EOS	1229.883460
SOS but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence EOS	393.703117
SOS nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related EOS	239.554745
SOS they were natural and just EOS	195.782580
SOS could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections EOS	304.146221
SOS to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own EOS	589.289759
SOS elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken TITLE darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	467.600656
SOS she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it EOS	303.139099
SOS again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification EOS	521.947746
SOS she went on EOS	102.175240
SOS from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry EOS	497.730429
SOS you have said quite enough madam EOS	281.202684
SOS i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been EOS	246.373783
SOS forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness EOS	448.510529
SOS and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house EOS	421.598081
SOS the tumult of her mind was now painfully great EOS	350.170888
SOS she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour EOS	519.420162
SOS her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it EOS	351.643633
SOS that she should receive an offer of marriage from TITLE darcy EOS	243.350902
SOS that he should have been in love with her for so many months EOS	187.228520
SOS so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible EOS	385.997595
SOS it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection EOS	588.445622
SOS but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned TITLE wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited EOS	566.768742
SOS she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room EOS	523.891488
SOS elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes EOS	547.668523
SOS she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise EOS	494.445197
SOS she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of TITLE darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road EOS	533.466686
SOS the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground EOS	438.560552
SOS after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park EOS	499.100871
SOS the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees EOS	411.744288
SOS she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being TITLE darcy she was directly retreating EOS	494.530352
SOS but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name EOS	562.851960
SOS she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be TITLE darcy she moved again towards the gate EOS	376.678294
SOS he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you EOS	423.053612
SOS will you do me the honour of reading that letter EOS	208.138906
SOS and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight EOS	403.557282
SOS with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand EOS	837.631961
SOS the envelope itself was likewise full EOS	657.110987
SOS pursuing her way along the lane she then began it EOS	457.593110
SOS it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you EOS	772.858607
SOS i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read EOS	518.729174
SOS you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice EOS	531.699202
SOS two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge EOS	631.712153
SOS the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached TITLE bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of TITLE wickham EOS	506.526279
SOS wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison EOS	639.271303
SOS but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read EOS	672.935579
SOS if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your s i can only say that i am sorry EOS	348.415969
SOS the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd EOS	550.214704
SOS i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country EOS	378.146235
SOS but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment EOS	247.512173
SOS i had often seen him in love before EOS	200.240716
SOS at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage EOS	464.604712
SOS he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided EOS	277.921214
SOS from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him EOS	400.353274
SOS your sister i also watched EOS	328.007935
SOS her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment EOS	600.717356
SOS if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error EOS	259.555967
SOS your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable EOS	448.458347
SOS if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable EOS	451.001653
SOS but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched EOS	486.131006
SOS that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears EOS	622.153994
SOS i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason EOS	345.108775
SOS my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me EOS	446.024786
SOS but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me EOS	750.789219
SOS these causes must be stated though briefly EOS	974.323367
SOS the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father EOS	661.487420
SOS pardon me EOS	181.823700
SOS it pains me to offend you EOS	296.606635
SOS but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both EOS	562.806023
SOS i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection EOS	553.999737
SOS he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning EOS	365.390116
SOS the part which i acted is now to be explained EOS	247.247783
SOS his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london EOS	786.455428
SOS we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice EOS	441.206709
SOS i described and enforced them earnestly EOS	559.898040
SOS but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference EOS	566.818880
SOS he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard EOS	319.473058
SOS but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own EOS	569.175565
SOS to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point EOS	389.045780
SOS to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment EOS	416.344337
SOS i cannot blame myself for having done thus much EOS	455.567490
SOS there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town EOS	388.755115
SOS i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it EOS	240.291701
SOS that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger EOS	470.407537
SOS perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me EOS	764.930968
SOS it is done however and it was done for the best EOS	158.915738
SOS on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer EOS	281.656851
SOS if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them EOS	549.682002
SOS with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured TITLE wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family EOS	548.228782
SOS of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity EOS	581.963529
SOS TITLE wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed EOS	499.293244
SOS my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education EOS	638.598420
SOS my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it EOS	460.532681
SOS as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner EOS	282.148699
SOS the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which TITLE darcy could not have EOS	487.734524
SOS here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell EOS	355.815209
SOS but whatever may be the sentiments which TITLE wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character EOS	583.885758
SOS it adds even another motive EOS	626.842606
SOS my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to TITLE wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant EOS	522.939665
SOS there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds EOS	459.238655
SOS his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events TITLE wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited EOS	756.013877
SOS he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein EOS	486.007393
SOS i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal EOS	498.133974
SOS i knew that TITLE wickham ought not to be a clergyman EOS	198.064702
SOS the business was therefore soon settled EOS	242.339163
SOS he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds EOS	404.588327
SOS all connection between us seemed now dissolved EOS	832.167691
SOS i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town EOS	348.985533
SOS in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation EOS	685.194929
SOS for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation EOS	325.900571
SOS his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad EOS	370.741724
SOS he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions EOS	465.313715
SOS you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it EOS	663.157837
SOS his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself EOS	331.588033
SOS after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt EOS	475.905832
SOS how he lived i know not EOS	179.850300
SOS but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice EOS	620.965976
SOS i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being EOS	514.886664
SOS having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy EOS	423.419741
SOS my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself EOS	464.830992
SOS about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went TITLE wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and TITLE younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement EOS	625.493145
SOS she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself EOS	326.647640
SOS i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me EOS	533.091433
SOS you may imagine what i felt and how i acted EOS	267.844178
SOS regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to TITLE wickham who left the place immediately and TITLE younge was of course removed from her charge EOS	509.712493
SOS TITLE wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement EOS	657.091285
SOS his revenge would have been complete indeed EOS	463.316353
SOS this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards TITLE wickham EOS	645.837131
SOS i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at EOS	357.699062
SOS ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination EOS	518.404263
SOS you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night EOS	413.239181
SOS but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed EOS	258.448454
SOS for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions EOS	626.629505
SOS if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning EOS	487.266291
SOS i will only add god bless you EOS	568.175207
SOS fitzwilliam darcy EOS	149.520839
SOS if elizabeth when TITLE darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents EOS	363.012777
SOS but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited EOS	432.405717
SOS her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined EOS	269.105871
SOS with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal EOS	381.734639
SOS with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield EOS	417.520759
SOS she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes EOS	454.309135
SOS his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice EOS	378.702838
SOS he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty EOS	461.969804
SOS it was all pride and insolence EOS	230.797452
SOS but when this subject was succeeded by his account of TITLE wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition EOS	804.609027
SOS astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her EOS	758.752720
SOS she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false EOS	702.742996
SOS this cannot be EOS	113.715392
SOS this must be the grossest falsehood EOS	366.689130
SOS and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again EOS	410.921415
SOS in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence EOS	454.108095
SOS the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late TITLE darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words EOS	381.006587
SOS so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great EOS	351.344523
SOS what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err EOS	394.364423
SOS but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate EOS	673.274798
SOS she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success EOS	672.290366
SOS on both sides it was only assertion EOS	453.433029
SOS again she read on EOS	158.602683
SOS but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render TITLE darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole EOS	645.885850
SOS the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to TITLE wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice EOS	553.119824
SOS she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance EOS	437.716674
SOS of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself EOS	286.874676
SOS as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring EOS	273.041236
SOS his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue EOS	412.051792
SOS she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of TITLE darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what TITLE darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance EOS	993.153186
SOS but no such recollection befriended her EOS	372.204842
SOS she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess EOS	501.421416
SOS after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read EOS	559.881443

SOS and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter EOS	312.105291
SOS with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn EOS	725.002041
SOS elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name EOS	347.468595

SOS their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter TITLE bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her EOS	622.411799
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun EOS	287.514645
SOS as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too EOS	505.893127
SOS and then when we came away it was such fun EOS	263.643424

SOS to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures EOS	495.668704

SOS in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme EOS	429.880459
SOS it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers EOS	256.095943
SOS there was another reason too for her opposition EOS	351.980462
SOS she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible EOS	322.839856

SOS in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account EOS	296.067858
SOS she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents EOS	479.099434
SOS elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last EOS	657.062254
SOS elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	400.902430
SOS miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings EOS	704.195332
SOS she was sorry that TITLE darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him EOS	417.976640
SOS his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment EOS	404.741068
SOS indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me EOS	476.379817
SOS you do not blame me however for refusing him EOS	294.581445

SOS no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did EOS	208.746174
SOS but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day EOS	222.855992
SOS she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham EOS	432.429214
SOS what a stroke was this for poor jane EOS	271.664406
SOS who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual EOS	881.178375
SOS nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery EOS	489.236700

SOS this will not do said elizabeth EOS	139.493969
SOS you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing EOS	218.855417

SOS no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both EOS	385.854992

SOS your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather EOS	741.184796
SOS poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance EOS	365.728797
SOS such an openness and gentleness in his manner EOS	364.310763
SOS there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men EOS	517.886597
SOS one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it EOS	191.535354
SOS i never thought TITLE darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do EOS	216.004946
SOS and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason EOS	450.330826
SOS it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind EOS	381.347462
SOS one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty EOS	799.625676
SOS lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now EOS	309.665443
SOS indeed i could not EOS	105.140863
SOS i was uncomfortable enough EOS	191.739312
SOS i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy EOS	287.334188
SOS and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had EOS	210.019561
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS how i wanted you EOS	153.105587
SOS how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to TITLE darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved EOS	519.852591
SOS certainly EOS	102.669634
SOS but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging EOS	424.882470
SOS there is one point on which i want your advice EOS	312.886550
SOS i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character EOS	401.465990
SOS miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully EOS	660.363170
SOS what is your own opinion EOS	192.682157
SOS that it ought not to be attempted EOS	170.825924
SOS TITLE darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public EOS	402.971866
SOS on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me EOS	355.493025
SOS the general prejudice against TITLE darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light EOS	373.741634
SOS i am not equal to it EOS	106.417218
SOS wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is EOS	346.854897
SOS sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before EOS	558.878422
SOS at present i will say nothing about it EOS	220.249132
SOS you are quite right EOS	225.648222
SOS to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever EOS	454.122725
SOS he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character EOS	431.812644
SOS we must not make him desperate EOS	288.938682
SOS the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation EOS	379.300138
SOS she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either EOS	420.255268
SOS but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure EOS	941.880277
SOS she dared not relate the other half of TITLE darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend EOS	389.568487
SOS here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery EOS	685.513659
SOS and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself EOS	440.903330
SOS the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value EOS	584.569683

SOS jane was not happy EOS	115.763694
SOS she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley EOS	460.975808
SOS having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity EOS	591.936793
SOS well lizzy said TITLE bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s EOS	345.424111
SOS for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody EOS	242.620872
SOS i told my sister philips so the other day EOS	244.020042
SOS but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london EOS	243.089272
SOS well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now EOS	304.520960
SOS there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know EOS	280.542526

SOS oh well EOS	146.061370
SOS it is just as he chooses EOS	250.408561
SOS nobody wants him to come EOS	315.163057
SOS though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it EOS	268.941546
SOS well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done EOS	369.244615
SOS but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer EOS	328.532574
SOS well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they EOS	476.991335

SOS well much good may it do them EOS	209.859092
SOS and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead EOS	366.513467
SOS they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens EOS	493.085462
SOS it was a subject which they could not mention before me EOS	187.614204
SOS no EOS	51.546248

SOS i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me EOS	265.734350
SOS the first week of their return was soon gone EOS	241.496499

SOS it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace EOS	328.723272
SOS the dejection was almost universal EOS	440.493816
SOS the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments EOS	861.139560
SOS very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family EOS	566.270797
SOS good heaven EOS	243.851516
SOS what is to become of us EOS	160.752548
SOS what are we to do EOS	121.061958

SOS their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago EOS	933.121803

SOS elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame EOS	364.374632
SOS she felt anew the justice of TITLE darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend EOS	344.194212
SOS but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from TITLE forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton EOS	384.753710
SOS this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married EOS	448.584758
SOS a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two EOS	403.360647
SOS the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of TITLE forster the delight of TITLE bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described EOS	337.512107
SOS wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish EOS	965.446490
SOS i cannot see why TITLE forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend EOS	315.180024
SOS i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older EOS	301.910914
SOS in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned EOS	291.961922
SOS as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go EOS	397.496783
SOS she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as TITLE forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home EOS	440.577917
SOS he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances EOS	483.818514
SOS if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair EOS	552.388944

SOS excuse me for i must speak plainly EOS	371.990346
SOS if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment EOS	392.095756
SOS her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous EOS	384.743367

SOS we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton EOS	404.257974

SOS colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body EOS	461.302538

SOS in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her EOS	604.434986

SOS when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door EOS	511.571363
SOS as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables EOS	593.684631
SOS they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight EOS	493.603542
SOS their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush EOS	666.362653
SOS he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility EOS	707.542801
SOS she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome EOS	709.256395
SOS had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw TITLE darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it EOS	480.878620
SOS they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family EOS	588.095169
SOS amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life EOS	457.858646
SOS nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts EOS	458.783489
SOS at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave EOS	685.680297
SOS the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence EOS	449.697187
SOS she was overpowered by shame and vexation EOS	367.704243
SOS her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world EOS	303.475911

SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS why did she come EOS	197.833454
SOS or why did he thus come a day before he was expected EOS	323.174832
SOS had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage EOS	536.784002
SOS she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting EOS	279.489111
SOS and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean EOS	434.890405
SOS that he should even speak to her was amazing EOS	230.470008

SOS she knew not what to think nor how to account for it EOS	183.320280
SOS they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene EOS	473.298411
SOS her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where TITLE darcy then was EOS	400.933261
SOS she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him EOS	252.907528
SOS perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease EOS	392.501205
SOS whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure EOS	257.738266
SOS at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself EOS	390.787158
SOS they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream EOS	916.588158
SOS TITLE gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk EOS	445.220322
SOS with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round EOS	482.181093
SOS it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts EOS	829.768335
SOS they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it EOS	959.035379
SOS elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house TITLE gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible EOS	572.797724
SOS her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for TITLE gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little EOS	549.123427
SOS whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of TITLE darcy approaching them and at no great distance EOS	423.780923
SOS the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met EOS	461.900369
SOS elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them EOS	497.235665
SOS for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path EOS	591.036141
SOS this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them EOS	605.792844
SOS with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed EOS	584.402898
SOS her colour changed and she said no more EOS	241.586884
SOS TITLE gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends EOS	300.059734
SOS this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself EOS	463.772534
SOS what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are EOS	270.264571
SOS he takes them now for people of fashion EOS	401.303713
SOS the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions EOS	476.848542
SOS that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with TITLE gardiner EOS	517.220421
SOS elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph EOS	201.906951
SOS it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush EOS	330.365451
SOS she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners EOS	567.338163
SOS the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard TITLE darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport EOS	714.629985
SOS TITLE gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder EOS	493.944103
SOS elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself EOS	260.609815
SOS her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered EOS	480.336970
SOS from what can it proceed EOS	255.523831
SOS it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened EOS	322.099253
SOS my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this EOS	402.325294
SOS it is impossible that he should still love me EOS	225.733398
SOS after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration EOS	879.517120
SOS it originated in TITLE gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s EOS	632.056399
SOS TITLE darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together EOS	271.694566
SOS after a short silence the lady first spoke EOS	330.615035
SOS she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country EOS	419.818425
SOS he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling EOS	363.863921
SOS they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you TITLE bingley and his sisters EOS	409.918454
SOS elizabeth answered only by a slight bow EOS	422.139082
SOS her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when TITLE bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged EOS	484.916571
SOS there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton EOS	453.695607
SOS the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it EOS	246.643806
SOS she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her EOS	333.134802
SOS they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought EOS	365.577248
SOS elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased EOS	227.883702
SOS his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind EOS	226.293861
SOS they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage TITLE and TITLE gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind EOS	399.482214
SOS he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn EOS	383.335679
SOS at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward EOS	246.388667
SOS she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject EOS	455.357527
SOS at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance EOS	608.866689
SOS yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over EOS	867.362807
SOS on TITLE and TITLE gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness EOS	443.332009
SOS TITLE darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house EOS	510.935948
SOS the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected EOS	353.614970
SOS he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle EOS	584.756513
SOS there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming EOS	327.279268
SOS i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it EOS	324.843468
SOS i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us EOS	214.929174
SOS it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention EOS	310.502540
SOS his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling EOS	239.488308
SOS to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good EOS	343.416381
SOS but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable EOS	221.183398
SOS elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning EOS	335.037695
SOS but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle EOS	364.448971
SOS your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds EOS	545.101744
SOS elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing EOS	309.945974
SOS from what we have seen of him continued TITLE gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham EOS	342.240811
SOS he has not an ill natured look EOS	327.846832
SOS on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks EOS	645.833895
SOS and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart EOS	342.685476
SOS but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character EOS	381.815979
SOS i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes EOS	689.753105
SOS but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue EOS	371.485750
SOS elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire EOS	410.632160
SOS in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on EOS	521.256571
SOS TITLE gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else EOS	461.610802
SOS fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance EOS	589.924367
SOS the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of TITLE darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister EOS	295.859101
SOS elizabeth had settled it that TITLE darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning EOS	278.518790
SOS but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came EOS	493.755260
SOS they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street EOS	437.633371
SOS elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected EOS	712.927851
SOS her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business EOS	324.384673
SOS nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece EOS	461.227239
SOS while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing EOS	1073.797591
SOS she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her EOS	678.194264
SOS she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse EOS	538.019396
SOS miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place EOS	473.417261
SOS with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself EOS	349.822587
SOS since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy EOS	395.332371
SOS she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable EOS	497.796779
SOS miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful EOS	649.852718
SOS she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle EOS	389.314541
SOS elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever TITLE darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings EOS	519.538544
SOS they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room EOS	363.043348
SOS all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again EOS	523.990835
SOS he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done EOS	434.631889
SOS to TITLE and TITLE gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself EOS	274.389094
SOS they had long wished to see him EOS	185.364552
SOS the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention EOS	530.811620
SOS the suspicions which had just arisen of TITLE darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love EOS	571.233844
SOS of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough EOS	399.063122
SOS elizabeth on her side had much to do EOS	133.206450
SOS she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour EOS	390.064790
SOS bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased EOS	355.490301
SOS in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh EOS	356.242647
SOS how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner EOS	346.160462
SOS sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance EOS	492.971532
SOS but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane EOS	296.985704
SOS no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard EOS	632.997871
SOS nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister EOS	353.303484
SOS on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared EOS	576.958043
SOS he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months EOS	308.704103
SOS we have not met since the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield EOS	537.011616
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn EOS	407.933160
SOS there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning EOS	328.907031
SOS it was not often that she could turn her eyes on TITLE darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day EOS	649.532122
SOS when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible EOS	614.203369
SOS never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings EOS	608.955212
SOS their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart TITLE darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing TITLE and TITLE gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country EOS	461.873766
SOS miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed EOS	674.201376
SOS TITLE gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head EOS	536.209771
SOS presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on EOS	649.192026
SOS bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends EOS	392.412165
SOS elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little EOS	439.323733
SOS eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress EOS	534.263216
SOS but she had no reason to fear TITLE and TITLE gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication EOS	251.860559
SOS it was evident that she was much better acquainted with TITLE darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her EOS	220.670563
SOS they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry EOS	384.105780
SOS of TITLE darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find EOS	275.903016
SOS they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for TITLE darcy EOS	403.646594
SOS there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected EOS	596.731306
SOS neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight EOS	716.502910
SOS they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit EOS	420.483527
SOS it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor EOS	291.861582
SOS with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which TITLE darcy afterwards discharged EOS	568.105808
SOS as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out EOS	449.960827
SOS she certainly did not hate him EOS	241.932868
SOS no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called EOS	492.593273
SOS the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced EOS	681.438143
SOS but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked EOS	397.836722
SOS it was gratitude EOS	110.383819

SOS such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined EOS	448.802609

SOS it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning EOS	393.712291

SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS how acutely did she now feel it EOS	341.930582
SOS she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe EOS	491.887815
SOS TITLE and TITLE gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy EOS	786.669629
SOS though lydia had never been a favourite with them TITLE and TITLE gardiner could not but be deeply affected EOS	280.078868
SOS not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror TITLE gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power EOS	427.342567
SOS elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled EOS	814.437975
SOS they were to be off as soon as possible EOS	168.857666

SOS cried TITLE gardiner EOS	168.848711
SOS john told us TITLE darcy was here when you sent for us was it so EOS	349.739721
SOS yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement EOS	322.426099
SOS that is all settled EOS	127.557574
SOS that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare EOS	301.249367
SOS and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth EOS	319.536789
SOS oh that i knew how it was EOS	146.802491
SOS but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour EOS	484.539844
SOS had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure EOS	460.488673
SOS an hour however saw the whole completed and TITLE gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn EOS	430.311109
SOS i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter EOS	399.807724
SOS it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best EOS	605.004380
SOS could he expect that her friends would not step forward EOS	298.252586
SOS could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster EOS	432.090520
SOS his temptation is not adequate to the risk EOS	353.320001
SOS do you really think so EOS	173.488687
SOS cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment EOS	415.136395
SOS upon my word said TITLE gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion EOS	286.988788
SOS it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it EOS	364.495535
SOS i cannot think so very ill of wickham EOS	192.422445
SOS can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it EOS	301.345905
SOS not perhaps of neglecting his own interest EOS	342.303910
SOS but of every other neglect i can believe him capable EOS	309.314781
SOS if indeed it should be so EOS	159.487244
SOS but i dare not hope it EOS	141.964123
SOS why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case EOS	245.120782
SOS in the first place replied TITLE gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland EOS	380.033748
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption EOS	690.261825
SOS and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road EOS	387.993235
SOS well then supposing them to be in london EOS	223.564622
SOS they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose EOS	453.507781
SOS it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland EOS	570.666091
SOS but why all this secrecy EOS	274.500777
SOS why any fear of detection EOS	455.999492
SOS why must their marriage be private EOS	375.533885
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS no no this is not likely EOS	166.499996
SOS his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her EOS	334.887981
SOS wickham will never marry a woman without some money EOS	416.482625
SOS he cannot afford it EOS	209.950774
SOS and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well EOS	745.688712
SOS as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce EOS	433.771666
SOS but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good EOS	353.378579
SOS lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter EOS	346.005233
SOS but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage EOS	283.798289
SOS it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt EOS	458.167568
SOS but really i know not what to say EOS	138.917548
SOS perhaps i am not doing her justice EOS	266.544546
SOS but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity EOS	436.019932
SOS she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way EOS	377.297094
SOS since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head EOS	514.133238
SOS she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it EOS	321.647613
SOS susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough EOS	565.327911
SOS and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman EOS	400.178619
SOS but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt EOS	240.190855
SOS of whom does jane ever think ill EOS	312.125112
SOS and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them EOS	418.793066
SOS but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is EOS	248.035176
SOS we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word EOS	320.532467
SOS that he has neither integrity nor honour EOS	498.355474
SOS that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating EOS	332.541093
SOS and do you really know all this EOS	152.052462
SOS cried TITLE gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive EOS	376.356732
SOS i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring EOS	353.033990
SOS i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to TITLE darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him EOS	352.185838
SOS and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless EOS	479.681021
SOS from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl EOS	485.823239
SOS yet he knew to the contrary himself EOS	246.770699
SOS he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her EOS	222.478620
SOS but does lydia know nothing of this EOS	195.433171
SOS can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand EOS	231.238670
SOS oh yes EOS	193.593882
SOS that that is the worst of all EOS	109.174593
SOS till i was in kent and saw so much both of TITLE darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself EOS	284.818465
SOS and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time EOS	317.725986
SOS as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown EOS	348.721645
SOS and even when it was settled that lydia should go with TITLE forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me EOS	303.780111
SOS that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head EOS	318.794092
SOS that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts EOS	460.485699
SOS when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other EOS	358.797754
SOS not the slightest EOS	140.560296
SOS i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away EOS	406.727624
SOS when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were EOS	313.856276
SOS every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites EOS	629.351122
SOS it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey EOS	591.570945
SOS from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent EOS	283.422246
SOS fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness EOS	887.287764
SOS they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day EOS	762.249099
SOS it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations EOS	290.300299
SOS the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome EOS	733.004286
SOS elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her EOS	995.896950
SOS elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives EOS	642.096213
SOS not yet replied jane EOS	193.638760
SOS but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well EOS	260.766489
SOS is my father in town EOS	157.536776
SOS yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word EOS	357.166657
SOS and have you heard from him often EOS	146.931220
SOS we have heard only once EOS	263.239718
SOS he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do EOS	416.238106
SOS he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention EOS	323.735214
SOS and my mother how is she EOS	112.902869
SOS how are you all EOS	118.313127

SOS cried elizabeth EOS	117.563446
SOS you look pale EOS	316.312937
SOS how much you must have gone through EOS	256.861862
SOS her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while TITLE and TITLE gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party EOS	349.690160
SOS jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears EOS	565.442591
SOS when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give EOS	323.879416
SOS the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage EOS	541.580092
SOS TITLE bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing EOS	916.707215
SOS if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her EOS	313.724744
SOS why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight EOS	458.806507
SOS i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after EOS	279.577426
SOS i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am EOS	283.864349
SOS poor dear child EOS	414.338058
SOS and now here s TITLE bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all EOS	364.084260
SOS the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do EOS	353.072953
SOS they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and TITLE gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist TITLE bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia EOS	413.892719
SOS do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain EOS	369.271734
SOS it is not quite a week since they left brighton EOS	330.532618
SOS in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost EOS	421.137526
SOS as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done EOS	308.799607
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS my dear brother replied TITLE bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for EOS	283.849918
SOS and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry EOS	382.757450
SOS and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married EOS	408.040171
SOS and above all things keep TITLE bennet from fighting EOS	557.339146
SOS tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day EOS	593.084623
SOS and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses EOS	396.931057
SOS oh brother how kind you are EOS	301.190427
SOS i know you will contrive it all EOS	203.948794
SOS but TITLE gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters EOS	389.547642
SOS though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject EOS	469.945453
SOS in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before EOS	560.478639
SOS one came from her books and the other from her toilette EOS	272.732134
SOS the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty EOS	511.017337
SOS as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of EOS	432.488727
SOS but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation EOS	1089.697994
SOS then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex EOS	717.249950
SOS elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply EOS	524.773367
SOS mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them EOS	639.561144
SOS in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy EOS	565.180423
SOS after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard EOS	494.824989

SOS i am so grieved for him EOS	172.684393
SOS his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost EOS	234.019903
SOS he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey EOS	457.199119
SOS and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry EOS	254.134241
SOS did he know of their intending to go off EOS	250.322507
SOS had colonel forster seen denny himself EOS	566.427730
SOS yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it EOS	573.924618
SOS he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before EOS	331.607340
SOS and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married EOS	395.559934
SOS how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains EOS	519.469046
SOS i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right EOS	373.128854
SOS my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be EOS	293.654106
SOS kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step EOS	415.865308

SOS i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did EOS	255.761489
SOS he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant EOS	252.772800
SOS and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false EOS	552.624473
SOS oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened EOS	361.042371
SOS perhaps it would have been better replied her sister EOS	223.018092
SOS but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable EOS	639.697663

SOS TITLE hill began instantly to express her joy EOS	508.303897
SOS elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom EOS	550.852202
SOS poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful EOS	387.748512
SOS she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained EOS	612.163063
SOS TITLE bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him EOS	550.092513
SOS he now wished it more than ever EOS	224.350084
SOS had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her EOS	378.036169
SOS the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place EOS	575.303145
SOS he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could EOS	388.579772
SOS when first TITLE bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son EOS	360.343332
SOS this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for EOS	439.084954
SOS five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and TITLE bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would EOS	454.570413
SOS this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving EOS	353.323203
SOS TITLE bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income EOS	596.359847
SOS five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on TITLE bennet and the children EOS	519.235500
SOS but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents EOS	429.107298
SOS this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and TITLE bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him EOS	306.247273
SOS in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him EOS	540.010982
SOS he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement EOS	331.355338
SOS he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expences had been very little within that sum EOS	574.257551
SOS that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible EOS	406.322766
SOS when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence EOS	649.190621
SOS his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution EOS	770.916585
SOS he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her EOS	337.610323
SOS the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood EOS	905.288821
SOS it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy EOS	431.699851
SOS to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house EOS	478.776418
SOS but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain EOS	446.106898
SOS it was a fortnight since TITLE bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high EOS	413.491266
SOS no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph EOS	510.341745
SOS the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants EOS	597.895096
SOS she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance EOS	744.542440
SOS haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off EOS	811.759192
SOS i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful EOS	456.643206
SOS her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained EOS	476.890153
SOS but when they had withdrawn he said to her TITLE bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding EOS	364.453262
SOS into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance EOS	476.427305
SOS i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn EOS	355.149755
SOS a long dispute followed this declaration but TITLE bennet was firm it soon led to another and TITLE bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter EOS	640.251100
SOS he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion EOS	406.912682
SOS TITLE bennet could hardly comprehend it EOS	248.071170
SOS that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible EOS	626.569873
SOS she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place EOS	506.256729
SOS elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make TITLE darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot EOS	472.680354
SOS she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means EOS	476.990439
SOS there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much EOS	524.713115
SOS not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them EOS	677.435107
SOS had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that TITLE darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned EOS	502.462782
SOS from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink EOS	307.606068
SOS the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this EOS	447.643976
SOS she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what EOS	360.447896
SOS she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it EOS	368.055693
SOS she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence EOS	398.671094
SOS she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet EOS	249.777569
SOS what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received EOS	615.909943
SOS he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex EOS	275.375561
SOS but while he was mortal there must be a triumph EOS	306.622280
SOS she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her EOS	337.176523
SOS his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes EOS	416.900675
SOS it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance EOS	441.303695
SOS but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was EOS	945.258570
SOS an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family EOS	358.820809
SOS how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine EOS	347.229103
SOS but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture EOS	881.726046
SOS TITLE gardiner soon wrote again to his brother EOS	252.646892
SOS to TITLE bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again EOS	416.949335
SOS the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that TITLE wickham had resolved on quitting the militia EOS	402.606525
SOS it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on EOS	254.847900

SOS lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites EOS	460.422840

SOS his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative EOS	582.843305

SOS when TITLE bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn EOS	340.460460

SOS repeated elizabeth in utter amazement EOS	516.020951
SOS oh yes EOS	193.593882
SOS he was to come there with wickham you know EOS	136.699741
SOS but gracious me EOS	191.274014
SOS i quite forgot EOS	261.303772
SOS i ought not to have said a word about it EOS	165.702100
SOS i promised them so faithfully EOS	399.709782
SOS what will wickham say EOS	167.190027
SOS it was to be such a secret EOS	125.080058
SOS if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject EOS	261.391121
SOS you may depend upon my seeking no further EOS	681.418922
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions EOS	603.396350
SOS thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry EOS	298.953824
SOS on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away EOS	358.736835
SOS but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information EOS	324.341982
SOS TITLE darcy had been at her sister s wedding EOS	177.870614
SOS it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go EOS	469.935295
SOS conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none EOS	480.355276
SOS those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable EOS	746.995792
SOS she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended EOS	612.107659
SOS you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time EOS	447.537695
SOS pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance EOS	565.683669
SOS not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out EOS	362.626378
SOS jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante EOS	484.943909
SOS elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could EOS	238.612788
SOS she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial EOS	388.261917
SOS gracechurch street sept EOS	1367.637926
SOS NUM EOS	263.992540
SOS my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you EOS	491.482878
SOS i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you EOS	339.999873
SOS don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side EOS	451.521904
SOS if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence EOS	443.204279
SOS your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done EOS	307.587521
SOS but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit EOS	416.335762
SOS on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor EOS	362.154342
SOS TITLE darcy called and was shut up with him several hours EOS	381.521724
SOS it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your s seems to have been EOS	362.735850
SOS he came to tell TITLE gardiner that he had found out where your sister and TITLE wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once EOS	301.809951
SOS from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them EOS	487.752816
SOS the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him EOS	430.288936
SOS he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world EOS	572.549527
SOS his character was to speak for itself EOS	214.844937
SOS he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself EOS	492.931576
SOS if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him EOS	322.366247
SOS he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us EOS	363.518845
SOS there is a lady it seems a TITLE younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what EOS	414.642902
SOS she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings EOS	991.307287
SOS this TITLE younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town EOS	307.974292
SOS but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted EOS	287.937697
SOS she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found EOS	422.665814
SOS wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her EOS	317.362038
SOS at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction EOS	677.730377
SOS they were in street EOS	157.328554
SOS he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia EOS	467.170082
SOS his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go EOS	361.906393
SOS but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was EOS	402.206198
SOS she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham EOS	304.548304
SOS she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when EOS	283.735155
SOS since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design EOS	423.054534
SOS he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone EOS	626.282034
SOS he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it EOS	445.138227
SOS he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on EOS	287.679555
SOS TITLE darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once EOS	281.651642
SOS though TITLE bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage EOS	305.043806
SOS but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country EOS	479.534619
SOS under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief EOS	489.723958
SOS they met several times for there was much to be discussed EOS	381.874071
SOS wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable EOS	384.763050
SOS every thing being settled between them TITLE darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home EOS	448.148592
SOS but TITLE gardiner could not be seen and TITLE darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning EOS	379.494477
SOS he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former EOS	516.478025
SOS he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business EOS	297.186715
SOS on saturday he came again EOS	257.082952
SOS your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together EOS	292.750863
SOS they met again on sunday and then i saw him too EOS	321.763451
SOS it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn EOS	264.902234
SOS but our visitor was very obstinate EOS	405.113735
SOS i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all EOS	474.866324
SOS he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one EOS	474.221603
SOS nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole EOS	302.994650
SOS they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved EOS	420.413038
SOS but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due EOS	588.469809
SOS but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most EOS	376.909131
SOS you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people EOS	325.294149
SOS his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased EOS	634.560043
SOS the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above EOS	243.088057
SOS it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was EOS	321.132204
SOS perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event EOS	595.892629
SOS but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair EOS	506.967396
SOS when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish EOS	446.455301
SOS i believe i have now told you every thing EOS	199.133511
SOS it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure EOS	327.803982
SOS lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house EOS	303.545382
SOS he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain EOS	356.764851
SOS i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family EOS	279.695373
SOS if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen EOS	285.203469
SOS i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her EOS	369.108219
SOS TITLE darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding EOS	336.708244
SOS he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday EOS	424.550494
SOS will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him EOS	351.154575
SOS his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire EOS	304.294151
SOS his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him EOS	587.029181
SOS i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name EOS	487.854299
SOS but slyness seems the fashion EOS	592.030135
SOS pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p EOS	670.495214
SOS i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park EOS	299.892202
SOS a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing EOS	603.809091
SOS but i must write no more EOS	173.359389
SOS the children have been wanting me this half hour EOS	406.595338
SOS your s very sincerely m EOS	518.270156
SOS gardiner EOS	83.152440
SOS the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share EOS	585.978783
SOS the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what TITLE darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true EOS	554.979271
SOS he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce EOS	639.649321
SOS he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem EOS	389.040952
SOS her heart did whisper that he had done it for her EOS	189.744912
SOS but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham EOS	563.712824
SOS brother in law of wickham EOS	200.292131
SOS every kind of pride must revolt from the connection EOS	439.014778
SOS he had to be sure done much EOS	137.407973
SOS she was ashamed to think how much EOS	167.082803
SOS but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief EOS	482.810017
SOS it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned EOS	468.457868
SOS it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return EOS	434.505246
SOS they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him EOS	284.632487
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him EOS	1095.968632
SOS for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him EOS	177.627370
SOS proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself EOS	258.896351
SOS she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again EOS	260.234426
SOS it was hardly enough but it pleased her EOS	175.186763
SOS she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between TITLE darcy and herself EOS	548.267855
SOS she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham EOS	520.280789
SOS i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister EOS	646.710849
SOS said he as he joined her EOS	126.528569
SOS you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome EOS	343.197639

SOS that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well EOS	260.579201
SOS at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented EOS	518.906509

SOS i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain EOS	401.620005
SOS i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him EOS	314.037408
SOS not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks EOS	339.350460
SOS elizabeth did not know what to make of it EOS	116.986023
SOS had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it EOS	408.190102
SOS yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation EOS	758.412035
SOS i will leave him to himself EOS	138.975164
SOS in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it EOS	311.666262
SOS they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them EOS	466.896563
SOS the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again EOS	744.979307
SOS as soon as ever TITLE bingley comes my dear said TITLE bennet you will wait on him of course EOS	296.013075
SOS no no EOS	78.055594
SOS you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters EOS	415.363783
SOS but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again EOS	372.086219
SOS his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield EOS	489.673658
SOS tis an etiquette i despise said he EOS	722.631937
SOS if he wants our society let him seek it EOS	523.067797
SOS he knows where we live EOS	435.458434
SOS i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again EOS	487.132936
SOS well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him EOS	307.020212
SOS but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined EOS	650.690147
SOS we must have TITLE long and the gouldings soon EOS	231.716014
SOS that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him EOS	422.897104
SOS consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see TITLE bingley in consequence of it before they did EOS	374.099405
SOS as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister EOS	264.556204
SOS it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of EOS	417.319421
SOS my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says EOS	365.479942
SOS happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over EOS	281.378411
SOS i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power EOS	256.720475
SOS you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much EOS	472.452443
SOS TITLE bingley arrived EOS	204.027114
SOS TITLE bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could EOS	364.840185
SOS she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before EOS	599.922973
SOS but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house EOS	540.358728
SOS her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy EOS	446.798235
SOS jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw TITLE darcy with him and sat down again by her sister EOS	329.271122
SOS there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be EOS	281.132309
SOS some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know EOS	278.277702

SOS and so it does i vow EOS	213.868127
SOS well any friend of TITLE bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him EOS	296.868476
SOS jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern EOS	258.126500
SOS she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter EOS	461.230956
SOS both sisters were uncomfortable enough EOS	512.162621
SOS each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of TITLE darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as TITLE bingley s friend without being heard by either of them EOS	260.094092
SOS but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew TITLE gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him EOS	422.565638
SOS to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley EOS	453.211146
SOS her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire EOS	451.517180
SOS the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken EOS	555.615250
SOS but she would not be secure EOS	140.031815
SOS let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation EOS	444.515493
SOS she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door EOS	631.650000
SOS jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected EOS	637.266833
SOS on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance EOS	847.574103
SOS elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command EOS	387.598781
SOS she had ventured only one glance at darcy EOS	344.038201
SOS he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley EOS	282.333508
SOS but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt EOS	205.218236
SOS it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture EOS	309.422665
SOS bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed EOS	526.310199
SOS he was received by TITLE bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend EOS	487.882740
SOS elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied EOS	669.096924
SOS darcy after enquiring of her how TITLE and TITLE gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing EOS	347.445321
SOS he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire EOS	181.123884
SOS there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself EOS	150.909762
SOS but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground EOS	561.908653
SOS more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed EOS	737.301667
SOS she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so EOS	219.397863
SOS could i expect it to be otherwise EOS	163.436153
SOS said she EOS	61.333613
SOS yet why did he come EOS	283.319926
SOS she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak EOS	221.052051
SOS she enquired after his sister but could do no more EOS	244.316696
SOS it is a long time TITLE bingley since you went away said TITLE bennet EOS	257.161728
SOS he readily agreed to it EOS	207.971301
SOS i began to be afraid you would never come back again EOS	279.795343
SOS people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true EOS	466.699017
SOS a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away EOS	480.852495
SOS miss lucas is married and settled EOS	268.209826
SOS and one of my own daughters EOS	147.812485
SOS i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers EOS	226.655957
SOS it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be EOS	170.893530
SOS it was only said lately george wickham esq EOS	603.358588
SOS to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing EOS	329.898950
SOS it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it EOS	322.800851
SOS did you see it EOS	112.594254
SOS bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations EOS	223.925902
SOS elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes EOS	431.063419
SOS how TITLE darcy looked therefore she could not tell EOS	240.748010
SOS it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time TITLE bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me EOS	261.828295
SOS they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long EOS	417.550491
SOS his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars EOS	292.747842
SOS thank heaven EOS	417.724799
SOS he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves EOS	355.210670
SOS elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at TITLE darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat EOS	372.130648
SOS it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present EOS	425.656099
SOS a few weeks he believed EOS	285.081043
SOS when you have killed all your own birds TITLE bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on TITLE bennet s manor EOS	494.481970
SOS i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you EOS	355.176582
SOS elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention EOS	844.711381
SOS were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion EOS	608.327197
SOS at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion EOS	506.914623
SOS the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them EOS	194.467620
SOS their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this EOS	628.294416
SOS let me never see either one or the other again EOS	310.825484
SOS yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover EOS	750.349024
SOS when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention EOS	269.643384
SOS he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty EOS	419.841014
SOS jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever EOS	277.287387
SOS but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent EOS	282.069866
SOS when the gentlemen rose to go away TITLE bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time EOS	437.960799
SOS you are quite a visit in my debt TITLE bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned EOS	376.929011
SOS i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement EOS	299.697325
SOS bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business EOS	455.133101
SOS they then went away EOS	229.916041
SOS TITLE bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year EOS	519.586991
SOS as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more EOS	592.970582
SOS TITLE darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her EOS	288.206344
SOS why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all EOS	331.301958
SOS she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure EOS	230.371613
SOS he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me EOS	245.602615
SOS if he fears me why come hither EOS	591.275757

SOS teazing teazing man EOS	814.231090
SOS i will think no more about him EOS	176.856262
SOS her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth EOS	495.428618
SOS now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy EOS	400.799885
SOS i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming EOS	325.250324
SOS i am glad he dines here on tuesday EOS	546.110156
SOS it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance EOS	594.172140
SOS yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly EOS	677.691631
SOS oh jane take care EOS	354.487867
SOS my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now EOS	299.487673
SOS i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever EOS	227.037605
SOS they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and TITLE bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived EOS	455.701744
SOS on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time EOS	526.732779
SOS when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister EOS	460.936815
SOS her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself EOS	698.389469
SOS on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided EOS	430.202208
SOS he placed himself by her EOS	197.397858
SOS elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend EOS	536.601397
SOS he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards TITLE darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm EOS	518.581246
SOS his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured EOS	500.848185
SOS though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour EOS	550.408470
SOS it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour EOS	323.450762
SOS TITLE darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them EOS	260.866394
SOS he was on one side of her mother EOS	131.798548
SOS she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage EOS	424.552010
SOS she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did EOS	390.457760
SOS her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family EOS	411.492181
SOS she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance EOS	617.883899
SOS anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil EOS	535.611387
SOS she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend EOS	307.928280
SOS if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever EOS	235.816022
SOS the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas EOS	323.895609
SOS the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair EOS	675.437548
SOS and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined EOS	462.456292
SOS we want none of them do we EOS	283.640716
SOS darcy had walked away to another part of the room EOS	219.509081
SOS she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly EOS	640.954630
SOS a man who has once been refused EOS	360.964423
SOS how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love EOS	315.906723
SOS is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman EOS	551.366393
SOS there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings EOS	473.271386
SOS she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still EOS	562.610194
SOS yes she will remain there till christmas EOS	541.494348
SOS and quite alone EOS	172.031731

SOS she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success EOS	259.311840
SOS he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away EOS	343.327578
SOS when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party EOS	627.965660
SOS she now lost every expectation of pleasure EOS	289.791427
SOS they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself EOS	351.785706
SOS TITLE bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them EOS	451.738103

SOS and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty EOS	297.709153

SOS TITLE bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals EOS	321.836069
SOS it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth EOS	211.705278

SOS bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter EOS	382.452239
SOS his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter EOS	580.670155
SOS he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and TITLE bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband EOS	577.036311

SOS but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her EOS	356.155450
SOS on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all EOS	558.815298
SOS their situation was awkward enough but her s she thought was still worse EOS	337.700542

SOS they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself EOS	506.848156
SOS it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever EOS	471.119577
SOS kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon EOS	524.439565
SOS TITLE bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when TITLE bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was EOS	523.078980
SOS not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you EOS	334.865254

SOS mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter EOS	650.280372
SOS bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept EOS	824.436878
SOS elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur EOS	450.035820

SOS he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty EOS	219.230447
SOS this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities EOS	608.839724
SOS elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him EOS	333.027176

SOS your ladyship wants TITLE darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable EOS	434.992528
SOS supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin EOS	364.692010
SOS allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged EOS	514.261922
SOS you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these EOS	508.138445
SOS how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine EOS	546.723397

SOS not so hasty if you please EOS	329.132796

SOS you are then resolved to have him EOS	157.293227
SOS i have said no such thing EOS	139.158287
SOS i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me EOS	470.582929
SOS it is well EOS	85.580856
SOS you refuse then to oblige me EOS	318.034607
SOS you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude EOS	531.989572

SOS neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance EOS	740.857351
SOS no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with TITLE darcy EOS	367.726345
SOS and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn EOS	324.735734
SOS and this is your real opinion EOS	197.692633
SOS this is your final resolve EOS	687.191089

SOS i shall now know how to act EOS	239.841655
SOS do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified EOS	467.434187
SOS i came to try you EOS	145.536267
SOS i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point EOS	420.085182
SOS in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet EOS	401.319940
SOS i send no compliments to your mother EOS	276.969379
SOS you deserve no such attention EOS	291.769638
SOS i am most seriously displeased EOS	442.535384
SOS elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself EOS	461.730722
SOS she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs EOS	498.077572
SOS her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself EOS	375.898010
SOS she did not choose it said her daughter she would go EOS	218.449329
SOS she is a very fine looking woman EOS	280.394200
SOS and her calling here was prodigiously civil EOS	423.665218
SOS for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well EOS	275.482927
SOS she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you EOS	428.071325
SOS i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy EOS	189.061187
SOS elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible EOS	391.625013
SOS the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly EOS	594.805948
SOS lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with TITLE darcy EOS	593.454368
SOS it was a rational scheme to be sure EOS	199.873021
SOS but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea EOS	364.346230
SOS she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together EOS	291.385742
SOS and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time EOS	549.943493
SOS in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference EOS	541.906585
SOS from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce EOS	392.613646
SOS she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side EOS	427.367300
SOS with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning EOS	823.732910
SOS if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him EOS	489.277349
SOS in that case he would return no more EOS	201.374782
SOS lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way EOS	333.652962
SOS if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it EOS	446.442880
SOS i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy EOS	465.161188
SOS if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all EOS	506.096244
SOS the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased TITLE bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject EOS	409.688694
SOS the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand EOS	307.521188
SOS lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room EOS	230.242072
SOS she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held EOS	342.126046
SOS it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations EOS	533.217268
SOS she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down EOS	330.605802
SOS he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly EOS	336.900803
SOS as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents EOS	549.247797
SOS i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony EOS	280.302961
SOS let me congratulate you on a very important conquest EOS	522.469030
SOS the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious EOS	512.566742
SOS young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer EOS	659.429867
SOS this letter is from TITLE collins EOS	167.870726
SOS from TITLE collins EOS	103.386984
SOS and what can he have to say EOS	104.470296
SOS something very much to the purpose of course EOS	203.805360
SOS he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases EOS	577.560816
SOS i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point EOS	448.581237
SOS what relates to yourself is as follows EOS	382.180646
SOS having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of TITLE collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority EOS	549.383054
SOS your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land EOS	588.105622
SOS can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this EOS	567.980630
SOS this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage EOS	1313.702966
SOS yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of EOS	701.636700
SOS have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is EOS	276.533830
SOS but now it comes out EOS	221.423283
SOS my motive for cautioning you is as follows EOS	408.091869
SOS we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye EOS	483.165346
SOS mr EOS	369.705068
SOS darcy you see is the man EOS	130.377544
SOS now lizzy i think i have surprised you EOS	191.312321
SOS could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related EOS	614.331622
SOS TITLE darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life EOS	365.405466
SOS it is admirable EOS	193.875522
SOS elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile EOS	647.409236
SOS never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her EOS	288.038834
SOS are you not diverted EOS	207.010151
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS yes EOS	98.360956
SOS pray read on EOS	276.439216
SOS after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match EOS	504.215888
SOS i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned EOS	450.751111
SOS TITLE collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known EOS	784.640264
SOS i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married EOS	616.168372
SOS it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it EOS	351.166087
SOS you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing EOS	488.808801
SOS that is his notion of christian forgiveness EOS	478.104784
SOS the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch EOS	417.690903
SOS but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it EOS	232.982140
SOS you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report EOS	450.730723
SOS for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn EOS	461.752861
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted EOS	478.897989
SOS but it is so strange EOS	163.154650
SOS yes that is what makes it amusing EOS	443.988655
SOS had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd EOS	534.203325
SOS much as i abominate writing i would not give up TITLE collins s correspondence for any consideration EOS	456.310730
SOS nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law EOS	509.176503
SOS and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report EOS	416.579142
SOS did she call to refuse her consent EOS	299.476479
SOS to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it EOS	322.396660
SOS elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not EOS	229.008258
SOS it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried EOS	261.890916
SOS her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of TITLE darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much EOS	421.045679
SOS instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected TITLE bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit EOS	398.001080
SOS the gentlemen arrived early and before TITLE bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out EOS	481.159180
SOS it was agreed to EOS	105.514354
SOS TITLE bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together EOS	504.064120
SOS bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them EOS	355.699475
SOS they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other EOS	550.785633
SOS very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same EOS	454.833532
SOS they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone EOS	623.339602
SOS now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said TITLE darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your s EOS	386.844867
SOS i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister EOS	545.695975
SOS ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it EOS	319.798687
SOS were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express EOS	242.781771
SOS i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness EOS	452.442498
SOS i did not think TITLE gardiner was so little to be trusted EOS	193.918331
SOS you must not blame my aunt EOS	210.661139
SOS lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars EOS	324.280571
SOS let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them EOS	466.365212
SOS if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone EOS	320.273605
SOS that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny EOS	400.789024
SOS but your family owe me nothing EOS	304.388406
SOS much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you EOS	182.192896
SOS elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word EOS	256.976990
SOS after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me EOS	488.201216
SOS if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once EOS	483.484411
SOS my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever EOS	485.724183
SOS elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances EOS	532.680455
SOS the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do EOS	403.014922
SOS had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable EOS	453.486825
SOS they walked on without knowing in what direction EOS	372.608138
SOS there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects EOS	226.233347
SOS she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give EOS	546.039031
SOS but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise EOS	687.988747
SOS it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before EOS	293.109059
SOS i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly EOS	486.984173
SOS elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that EOS	346.087914
SOS after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations EOS	466.216230
SOS what did you say of me that i did not deserve EOS	181.124062
SOS for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof EOS	848.540807
SOS it was unpardonable EOS	153.793251
SOS i cannot think of it without abhorrence EOS	218.563523
SOS we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth EOS	441.199364
SOS the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility EOS	727.125886
SOS i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself EOS	319.476087
SOS the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me EOS	377.458678
SOS your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner EOS	547.752778
SOS those were your words EOS	265.217322
SOS you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice EOS	478.040727
SOS i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression EOS	427.881695
SOS i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way EOS	228.103249
SOS i can easily believe it EOS	200.256434
SOS you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did EOS	419.370731
SOS the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me EOS	307.053994
SOS oh EOS	90.689046
SOS do not repeat what i then said EOS	235.075694
SOS these recollections will not do at all EOS	262.148234

SOS darcy mentioned his letter EOS	210.771587
SOS did it said he did it soon make you think better of me EOS	192.613814
SOS did you on reading it give any credit to its contents EOS	384.424956
SOS she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed EOS	453.415361
SOS i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary EOS	248.850748
SOS i hope you have destroyed the letter EOS	215.572364
SOS there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again EOS	356.897171
SOS i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me EOS	657.204048
SOS the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies EOS	595.831296
SOS when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit EOS	552.426082
SOS the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so EOS	313.524272
SOS the adieu is charity itself EOS	711.443550
SOS but think no more of the letter EOS	122.042060
SOS the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten EOS	444.838591
SOS you must learn some of my philosophy EOS	310.382373
SOS think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure EOS	447.649726
SOS i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind EOS	272.936187
SOS your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance EOS	603.956264
SOS but with me it is not so EOS	97.692922
SOS painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled EOS	691.957674

SOS as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper EOS	348.991313
SOS i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit EOS	472.733531
SOS unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own EOS	714.666248

SOS you blamed me for coming EOS	323.356759
SOS no indeed i felt nothing but surprise EOS	265.723352
SOS your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you EOS	380.275698
SOS my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due EOS	473.704415
SOS my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to EOS	466.143606
SOS how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you EOS	489.556617
SOS he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend EOS	516.698190
SOS she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther EOS	331.202297
SOS after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home EOS	549.664157
SOS what could become of TITLE bingley and jane EOS	175.442680
SOS was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs EOS	369.271005
SOS darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it EOS	325.368577
SOS i must ask whether you were surprised EOS	287.932704

SOS i guessed as much EOS	198.665000
SOS and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case EOS	300.977255
SOS on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago EOS	287.367696
SOS i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent EOS	398.510394
SOS his surprise was great EOS	153.407029
SOS he had never had the slightest suspicion EOS	261.560924
SOS i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together EOS	353.283732
SOS elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend EOS	440.301930
SOS did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring EOS	473.698765
SOS from the former EOS	105.240979
SOS i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection EOS	343.202191
SOS and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him EOS	328.346289
SOS it did EOS	67.709980
SOS bingley is most unaffectedly modest EOS	806.419367
SOS his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy EOS	682.741780
SOS i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him EOS	318.272134
SOS i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him EOS	358.962564
SOS he was angry EOS	122.460180
SOS but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments EOS	474.193082
SOS he has heartily forgiven me now EOS	528.412802
SOS elizabeth longed to observe that TITLE bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself EOS	574.802251
SOS she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin EOS	326.972205
SOS in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house EOS	293.029948
SOS in the hall they parted EOS	220.334692
SOS my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to EOS	255.253777
SOS was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table EOS	270.460499
SOS she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge EOS	317.310345
SOS she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth EOS	451.760325
SOS the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary EOS	752.888847
SOS the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent EOS	707.640304
SOS darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her EOS	462.237277
SOS she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away EOS	339.554115
SOS at night she opened her heart to jane EOS	232.399573
SOS though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here EOS	670.900850

SOS you know nothing of the matter EOS	137.436378
SOS that is all to be forgot EOS	135.274144
SOS perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now EOS	226.514848
SOS but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable EOS	464.582155
SOS this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself EOS	258.378221
SOS miss bennet still looked all amazement EOS	428.679942

SOS very very much EOS	116.055604
SOS nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight EOS	453.679910
SOS but we considered it we talked of it as impossible EOS	234.448456
SOS and do you really love him quite well enough EOS	262.365647
SOS oh lizzy EOS	177.002379
SOS do any thing rather than marry without affection EOS	448.852729

SOS will you tell me how long you have loved him EOS	277.105823
SOS it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began EOS	307.326712
SOS but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley EOS	465.404415
SOS another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment EOS	611.181204
SOS when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish EOS	384.272440
SOS now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself EOS	219.451747
SOS i always had a value for him EOS	167.971491
SOS were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me EOS	258.337699
SOS but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me EOS	338.529157
SOS how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton EOS	306.011302
SOS i owe all that i know of it to another not to you EOS	127.178046
SOS elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy EOS	225.374512
SOS she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend EOS	341.517784
SOS but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage EOS	305.696675
SOS all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation EOS	302.031645

SOS what shall we do with him EOS	164.034109
SOS lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way EOS	231.113087
SOS elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet EOS	690.616338
SOS as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud TITLE bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day EOS	561.312992
SOS i advise TITLE darcy and lizzy and kitty said TITLE bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning EOS	416.514840
SOS it is a nice long walk and TITLE darcy has never seen the view EOS	321.221999
SOS it may do very well for the others replied TITLE bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty EOS	250.702826

SOS so do not put yourself to inconvenience EOS	325.340880
SOS during their walk it was resolved that TITLE bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening EOS	294.856630
SOS elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s EOS	224.319545
SOS she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man EOS	470.221929
SOS but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that TITLE darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation EOS	461.588855
SOS in the evening soon after TITLE bennet withdrew to the library she saw TITLE darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme EOS	414.838644
SOS she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till TITLE darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile EOS	440.325668
SOS in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library EOS	414.399719
SOS she was gone directly EOS	179.602126

SOS are you out of your senses to be accepting this man EOS	298.998968
SOS have not you always hated him EOS	214.633003
SOS how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate EOS	611.990238
SOS it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to TITLE darcy EOS	345.270855
SOS or in other words you are determined to have him EOS	207.916213
SOS he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane EOS	381.457258
SOS but will they make you happy EOS	164.687633
SOS have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference EOS	340.962120
SOS none at all EOS	166.680974
SOS we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him EOS	317.450882

SOS indeed he has no improper pride EOS	474.359214
SOS he is perfectly amiable EOS	210.230225
SOS you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms EOS	301.659739
SOS lizzy said her father i have given him my consent EOS	261.294961
SOS he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask EOS	360.691921
SOS i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him EOS	192.194580
SOS but let me advise you to think better of it EOS	212.784972
SOS i know your disposition lizzy EOS	236.392682
SOS i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior EOS	525.133068
SOS your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage EOS	594.704735
SOS you could scarcely escape discredit and misery EOS	580.281396
SOS my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life EOS	438.009808
SOS you know not what you are about EOS	151.567420
SOS elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that TITLE darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match EOS	610.781830
SOS well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say EOS	261.942340
SOS if this be the case he deserves you EOS	223.654703
SOS i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy EOS	277.611505

SOS this is an evening of wonders indeed EOS	331.608340

SOS so much the better EOS	118.949141
SOS it will save me a world of trouble and economy EOS	362.823007
SOS had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way EOS	502.145146
SOS i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter EOS	365.459583
SOS he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading TITLE collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure EOS	484.037852
SOS elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure EOS	576.436452
SOS every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time EOS	572.974072
SOS when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication EOS	382.095542
SOS its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it TITLE bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable EOS	581.549804
SOS nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them EOS	325.735331
SOS she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself EOS	743.734109

SOS but my dearest love tell me what dish TITLE darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow EOS	356.383270

SOS but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for TITLE bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion EOS	468.349502

SOS i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your s EOS	180.763480
SOS my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing EOS	298.197646
SOS lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use EOS	380.742922
SOS but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for EOS	242.828287
SOS was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed EOS	253.477872
SOS or had you intended any more serious consequence EOS	377.909016
SOS my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me EOS	272.127078
SOS my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made EOS	319.894575
SOS shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her EOS	336.853717
SOS i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth EOS	318.044058
SOS but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly EOS	302.766785
SOS and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did EOS	350.633347
SOS but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected EOS	320.362415
SOS from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with TITLE darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered TITLE gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write EOS	516.865700
SOS you supposed more than really existed EOS	488.143581
SOS but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err EOS	797.207808
SOS you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last EOS	317.475235
SOS i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes EOS	201.302077

SOS we will go round the park every day EOS	377.797114
SOS i am the happiest creature in the world EOS	217.166762
SOS perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice EOS	317.229285
SOS i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh EOS	489.535911
SOS TITLE darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me EOS	276.233249
SOS you are all to come to pemberley at christmas EOS	218.159116
SOS your s c EOS	193.545949
SOS TITLE darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what TITLE bennet sent to TITLE collins in reply to his last EOS	295.880634
SOS dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations EOS	398.415743
SOS elizabeth will soon be the wife of TITLE darcy EOS	137.330439
SOS console lady catherine as well as you can EOS	272.690592
SOS but if i were you i would stand by the nephew EOS	193.935644
SOS he has more to give EOS	122.683339
SOS your s sincerely c EOS	385.775510
SOS miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere EOS	360.914776
SOS she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard EOS	376.638967
SOS jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved EOS	446.024374
SOS the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it EOS	529.117349
SOS four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister EOS	541.876115
SOS before any answer could arrive from TITLE collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge EOS	491.842192
SOS the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident EOS	399.920495
SOS lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over EOS	601.703545
SOS at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw TITLE darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband EOS	422.078811
SOS he bore it however with admirable calmness EOS	611.981652
SOS he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st EOS	721.486991
SOS james s with very decent composure EOS	659.460179
SOS if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight EOS	467.996936
SOS TITLE philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though TITLE philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar EOS	593.693433
SOS nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant EOS	312.617485
SOS elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley EOS	392.230811
SOS happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which TITLE bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters EOS	478.930994
SOS with what delighted pride she afterwards visited TITLE bingley and talked of TITLE darcy may be guessed EOS	449.266219
SOS i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly EOS	512.219788
SOS TITLE bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do EOS	628.958637
SOS he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected EOS	351.080772
SOS TITLE bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth EOS	326.709999
SOS so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart EOS	489.079889
SOS the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other EOS	611.411764
SOS kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters EOS	385.956190
SOS in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great EOS	334.979539
SOS she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid EOS	654.624561
SOS from the farther disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though TITLE wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going EOS	390.668012
SOS mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by TITLE bennet s being quite unable to sit alone EOS	544.281540
SOS mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance EOS	553.276024
SOS as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters EOS	394.899302
SOS he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune EOS	440.213025
SOS the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished EOS	360.992577
SOS the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy EOS	265.461347
SOS if you love TITLE darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy EOS	242.833397
SOS it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us EOS	216.099230
SOS i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help EOS	455.627867
SOS any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to TITLE darcy about it if you had rather not EOS	364.082231
SOS yours c EOS	608.405858
SOS as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind EOS	296.856970
SOS such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them EOS	472.954232
SOS it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills EOS	708.757496
SOS their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme EOS	504.088257
SOS they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought EOS	585.607427
SOS his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her s lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her EOS	421.794077
SOS though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him farther in his profession EOS	474.592608
SOS lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone EOS	495.644317
SOS miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth EOS	632.380765
SOS pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see EOS	285.895719
SOS they were able to love each other even as well as they intended EOS	329.846586
SOS georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother EOS	510.173679
SOS he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry EOS	546.338309
SOS her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way EOS	402.870872
SOS by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself EOS	507.051850
SOS lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end EOS	481.495870
SOS but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city EOS	495.388776
SOS with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms EOS	336.642820
SOS darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them EOS	482.753003
