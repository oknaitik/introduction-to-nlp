SOS they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others EOS	9542.051559
SOS they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade EOS	21050.964112
SOS TITLE bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it EOS	8525.946937
SOS TITLE bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase EOS	6747.778121
SOS his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was TITLE hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her EOS	7935.305730
SOS TITLE bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house EOS	10889.654437

SOS if i may so express it he has a right to be proud EOS	25758.703172
SOS that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine EOS	13598.264463
SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	3865.378109

SOS vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously EOS	2146.846959

SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	10320.254369
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	15441.082654
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	5682.727115
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	13103.012166
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	6767.416460
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	12249.144537
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	9220.849417
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	6694.819883
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	16454.174768
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	16138.106846
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	23991.743865
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	10743.436812
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	9767.730248
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	17029.228174
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	6398.457721
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	16859.963125
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	36952.444324
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	6904.097562
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	28658.558857
SOS as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness EOS	8359.082803
SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	21032.608026
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	8320.010328
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	11005.860561
SOS not as you represent it EOS	49045.897798
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	5437.640305
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	3075.756464
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	16745.943701
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	5856.424371
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	6687.874395
SOS they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life EOS	10115.702429
SOS you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound EOS	20952.341693
SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	33660.550485
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	12133.212474
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	11618.108038
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	9732.348804
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	9113.664646
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	9016.704918
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	10374.781451
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	14225.076072
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	11475.117627

SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	15955.766827
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	10210.802504
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	6367.628576
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	5319.198539

SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	8188.520736
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	14170.623732
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	7280.535700
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	7500.744253
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	7001.696934

SOS whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes EOS	6323.548772
SOS at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here EOS	2087.579486
SOS that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth EOS	34513.371948
SOS you begin to comprehend me do you EOS	10922.871635
SOS cried he turning towards her EOS	6959.381245
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS yes i understand you perfectly EOS	5968.403791
SOS i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful EOS	5814.575435
SOS that is as it happens EOS	49045.897798
SOS it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours EOS	9290.244334
SOS lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home EOS	8267.361768
SOS i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character EOS	10544.284137
SOS it must be an amusing study EOS	40156.621597
SOS yes but intricate characters are the most amusing EOS	11679.079142
SOS they have at least that advantage EOS	17275.615989
SOS the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study EOS	14257.928436
SOS in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society EOS	10838.912667
SOS but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever EOS	9100.111487
SOS yes indeed cried TITLE bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood EOS	7053.574432
SOS i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town EOS	16675.528074
SOS every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away EOS	9019.454035
SOS TITLE bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph EOS	8813.532333
SOS i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places EOS	4527.430583
SOS the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it TITLE bingley EOS	16533.185590
SOS when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same EOS	9417.484590
SOS they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either EOS	11552.573058
SOS aye that is because you have the right disposition EOS	11997.959207
SOS but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all EOS	12529.088517
SOS indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother EOS	9894.997588
SOS you quite mistook TITLE darcy EOS	10345.277136
SOS he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true EOS	19392.291959
SOS certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger EOS	8802.363759
SOS i know we dine with four and twenty families EOS	15200.367151
SOS nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance EOS	8760.438872
SOS his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards TITLE darcy with a very expressive smile EOS	13650.689737
SOS elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away EOS	4133.772526
SOS yes she called yesterday with her father EOS	5396.648747
SOS what an agreeable man sir william is TITLE bingley is not he EOS	12707.009689
SOS so much the man of fashion EOS	20805.522468
SOS so genteel and so easy EOS	23991.502725
SOS he has always something to say to every body EOS	13428.696026
SOS that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter EOS	6414.612554
SOS did charlotte dine with you EOS	5112.558467
SOS no she would go home EOS	11730.694043
SOS i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies EOS	4316.317184
SOS for my part TITLE bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently EOS	6308.844164
SOS but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you EOS	10276.879956
SOS it is a pity they are not handsome EOS	28843.702721
SOS not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend EOS	8920.247201
SOS she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley EOS	17836.531997
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS dear yes but you must own she is very plain EOS	31123.316949
SOS lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty EOS	7496.227266
SOS i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking EOS	5417.883016
SOS it is what every body says EOS	21594.241200
SOS i do not trust my own partiality EOS	10776.639810
SOS when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away EOS	17882.381025
SOS but however he did not EOS	9231.665646
SOS perhaps he thought her too young EOS	14249.297744
SOS however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were EOS	13039.534272
SOS and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently EOS	22752.468837
SOS there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way EOS	16797.203108
SOS i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love EOS	5024.493609
SOS i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy EOS	15304.548150
SOS of a fine stout healthy love it may EOS	10310.088363
SOS every thing nourishes what is strong already EOS	10370.762688
SOS but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away EOS	5185.367034
SOS darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again EOS	9176.110322
SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	12648.796441
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	13233.511826
SOS she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but TITLE bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage EOS	8896.267712
SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	4687.406755
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	9657.303507
SOS lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age EOS	7323.231565
SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	5366.273493
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	16629.358898
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	13761.275381
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	13693.687489
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	13378.058390
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	4029.399720
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	8730.958629
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	13963.827015
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	9192.172689
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	9928.791091
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	25156.902214
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	8523.205669
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	1916.035906
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	8749.343667
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	20952.764412
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	7618.542168
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	9017.431359
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	11180.105691
SOS he made no answer EOS	8616.338468
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	8395.779352
SOS you are mistaken EOS	26500.990920
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	6818.127691
SOS how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year EOS	9991.563477
SOS letters of business too EOS	12796.634535
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	56855.104448
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	14467.983388
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	16085.352138
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	11214.008321
SOS i am afraid you do not like your pen EOS	4705.051208
SOS let me mend it for you EOS	25772.218903
SOS i mend pens remarkably well EOS	11222.961313
SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	18481.485780
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	16627.769648
SOS he was silent EOS	25190.334513
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	6401.801700
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	15132.685902
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	15462.493924
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	33720.571431
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	56855.104448
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	6732.679414
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	10483.856055
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	10093.191039
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	6602.175510
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	12075.128075
SOS do not you darcy EOS	19981.059942
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	14985.249106
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	8612.439999
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	4430.245829
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	8497.229818
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	23711.365320
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	20264.392462
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	5287.228800
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	6877.603546
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	7890.130532
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	5340.132017
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	7888.580855
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	15219.264761
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	9658.590632
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	4242.580932
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	10752.475547
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	7190.248607
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	12887.013478
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	12563.493524
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	9653.903688
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	11208.155898
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	10907.726665
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	9947.181169
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	14176.643239
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	9492.786950
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	15458.445882
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	14144.946576
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	11806.806563
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	12981.409482
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	9876.474864
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	7461.384605
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	9205.834590
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	10020.420297
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	12994.889435
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	15082.228925
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	8830.777922
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	11211.322622
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	9618.704274
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	22898.957394
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	13600.693401
SOS perhaps i do EOS	4377.219482
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	9069.094196
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	12267.643525
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	18188.838296
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	7598.188337
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	14505.898964
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	11340.843984
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	10258.990902
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	9836.350836
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	5487.947964
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	9947.199310
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	11966.946650
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	5206.403868
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	8229.749770
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	12413.625266
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	22957.125114
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	6583.697440
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	6332.272030
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	4461.503083
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	13789.786285
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	22499.188299
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	8950.579737
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	9553.160855
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	10120.197845
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	7199.698478
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	11262.846468
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS yes EOS	9049.942102
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	6035.890020
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	5236.398644
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	18164.588969
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	10346.790609
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	7544.112951
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	9276.459315
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	14467.300039
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	3227.623179
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	7987.218358
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	4530.530796
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	6063.995883
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	7735.204821
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	15211.048792
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	5918.122625
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	8351.760755
SOS good bye EOS	5073.069379
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	5662.921688
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	17242.096940
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	8180.841278
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	12482.985256
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	10203.055927
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	8744.384206
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	9731.539659
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	8564.092900
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	13489.559613
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	6695.367822
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	3723.333149
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	6881.698876
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	11314.507887
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	6415.751144
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	13034.975150
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	9996.216271
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	3918.993521
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	11376.528417
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	5380.868776
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	12324.736427
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	15465.717707
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	13877.637598
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	28988.551250
SOS no one made any reply EOS	4183.943989
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	7599.260378
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	10783.525895
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	12311.840999
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	7731.040750
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	14256.313197
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	17666.880234
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	3879.341262
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	8268.364080
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	11191.059851
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	13990.363104
SOS elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately EOS	15254.315987
SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	5440.093873
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	20265.611947
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	8160.224355
SOS what could he mean EOS	30307.131471
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	24950.994621
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	9028.604833
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	7085.540723
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	25251.876506
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	9509.838950
SOS oh EOS	8336.541990
SOS shocking EOS	26083.288841
SOS cried miss bingley EOS	4691.705215
SOS i never heard any thing so abominable EOS	9999.508361
SOS how shall we punish him for such a speech EOS	41042.292453
SOS nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth EOS	19450.130676
SOS we can all plague and punish one another EOS	24767.887757
SOS teaze him laugh at him EOS	13661.316162
SOS intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done EOS	35092.976291
SOS but upon my honour i do not EOS	8210.745594
SOS i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that EOS	11504.683107
SOS teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind EOS	5801.565024
SOS no no i feel he may defy us there EOS	17659.698111
SOS and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject EOS	19052.737752
SOS TITLE darcy may hug himself EOS	25785.226064
SOS TITLE darcy is not to be laughed at EOS	48134.102085
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	15120.123179
SOS that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance EOS	13878.576946
SOS i dearly love a laugh EOS	25985.093735
SOS miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be EOS	21041.741234
SOS the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke EOS	7870.826119
SOS certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them EOS	11583.356528
SOS i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good EOS	13108.079021
SOS follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can EOS	12008.014131
SOS but these i suppose are precisely what you are without EOS	14353.844876
SOS perhaps that is not possible for any one EOS	9504.684894
SOS but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule EOS	8172.176130
SOS such as vanity and pride EOS	16833.654183
SOS yes vanity is a weakness indeed EOS	5579.857208
SOS but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation EOS	2584.403339
SOS elizabeth turned away to hide a smile EOS	4394.434575
SOS your examination of TITLE darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result EOS	19226.520635
SOS i am perfectly convinced by it that TITLE darcy has no defect EOS	16036.282563
SOS he owns it himself without disguise EOS	19965.878095
SOS no said darcy i have made no such pretension EOS	32823.760368
SOS i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding EOS	15706.780343
SOS my temper i dare not vouch for EOS	17021.322225
SOS it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world EOS	8796.861560
SOS i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself EOS	7601.360980
SOS my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them EOS	16347.389241
SOS my temper would perhaps be called resentful EOS	8890.909703
SOS my good opinion once lost is lost for ever EOS	2456.752279
SOS that is a failing indeed EOS	10415.037404
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	15120.123179
SOS implacable resentment is a shade in a character EOS	9560.382810
SOS but you have chosen your fault well EOS	32006.509733
SOS i really cannot laugh at it EOS	18587.229047
SOS you are safe from me EOS	44824.287191
SOS there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome EOS	9953.945723
SOS and your defect is a propensity to hate every body EOS	15128.329628
SOS and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them EOS	15868.786258
SOS do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share EOS	4848.953101
SOS louisa you will not mind my waking TITLE hurst EOS	11739.975487
SOS her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it EOS	13264.675114
SOS he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention EOS	11734.204836
SOS in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day EOS	10356.526736
SOS but TITLE bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before EOS	9841.929542
SOS her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home EOS	8678.742116
SOS TITLE bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if TITLE bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well EOS	21280.707033
SOS against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow TITLE bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made EOS	5090.755851
SOS the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred EOS	6204.171522
SOS miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other EOS	11903.362966
SOS the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right EOS	10524.702191
SOS to TITLE darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough EOS	12189.608804
SOS she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself EOS	21987.392620
SOS he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it EOS	8180.916272
SOS steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her EOS	6552.835527
SOS on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place EOS	5221.139740
SOS miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former EOS	11166.989477
SOS elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits EOS	9482.760938

SOS TITLE bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again EOS	15746.949929
SOS but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle EOS	8536.851185
SOS the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth EOS	17182.975090
SOS they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to EOS	5380.032313
SOS catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort EOS	20563.156620
SOS much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married EOS	9207.089077
