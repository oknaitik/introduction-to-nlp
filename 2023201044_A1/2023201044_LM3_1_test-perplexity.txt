SOS between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character EOS	360.232269
SOS bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied EOS	671.612884
SOS on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion EOS	411.248963
SOS in understanding darcy was the superior EOS	190.228890
SOS bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever EOS	384.741830
SOS he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting EOS	622.036657
SOS in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage EOS	256.648610
SOS bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence EOS	712.682051
SOS the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic EOS	486.079314
SOS bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful EOS	590.275784
SOS darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure EOS	530.896019
SOS miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much EOS	316.611369
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of EOS	274.272440
SOS miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose EOS	483.626982
SOS within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate EOS	581.283853
SOS sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty EOS	719.709181
SOS the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly EOS	463.279723
SOS it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world EOS	610.387513
SOS for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body EOS	508.412191
SOS by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st EOS	1290.040173
SOS james s had made him courteous EOS	530.770244
SOS lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to TITLE bennet EOS	354.367630
SOS they had several children EOS	273.992885
SOS the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend EOS	772.693319
SOS that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate EOS	406.148760
SOS you began the evening well charlotte said TITLE bennet with civil self command to miss lucas EOS	476.311121
SOS you were TITLE bingley s first choice EOS	226.301718
SOS yes but he seemed to like his second better EOS	299.464040
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice EOS	436.632480
SOS to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about TITLE robinson EOS	419.783928
SOS perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and TITLE robinson did not i mention it to you EOS	350.887019
SOS TITLE robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest EOS	545.293529
SOS and his answering immediately to the last question oh EOS	334.025168
SOS the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point EOS	453.553051
SOS upon my word EOS	227.616248
SOS well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know EOS	316.164595
SOS my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte EOS	585.305642
SOS TITLE darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he EOS	230.006650
SOS poor eliza EOS	348.648290
SOS to be only just tolerable EOS	210.902805
SOS i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him EOS	364.460475
SOS TITLE long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips EOS	553.219876
SOS are you quite sure ma am EOS	379.908149
SOS is not there a little mistake EOS	208.338617
SOS said jane EOS	97.359157
SOS i certainly saw TITLE darcy speaking to her EOS	176.244229
SOS aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to EOS	446.975328
SOS miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance EOS	628.401562
SOS with them he is remarkably agreeable EOS	266.890588
SOS i do not believe a word of it my dear EOS	158.011442
SOS if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to TITLE long EOS	206.824629
SOS but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that TITLE long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise EOS	488.789487
SOS i do not mind his not talking to TITLE long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza EOS	310.300742
SOS another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you EOS	236.045295
SOS i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him EOS	450.255118
SOS his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it EOS	512.587765
SOS one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself EOS	446.393546
SOS if i may so express it he has a right to be proud EOS	237.493482
SOS that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine EOS	399.602793
SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	894.190603
SOS by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary EOS	571.643960
SOS vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously EOS	882.859139
SOS a person may be proud without being vain EOS	432.308950
SOS pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us EOS	474.102744
SOS if i were as rich as TITLE darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was EOS	317.414067
SOS i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day EOS	823.697093
SOS then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said TITLE bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly EOS	375.372611
SOS the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit EOS	403.235549
SOS the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield EOS	333.694852
SOS the visit was returned in due form EOS	377.897328
SOS miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of TITLE hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest EOS	417.336883
SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	480.398688
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	398.096297
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	209.449102
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	388.766017
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	450.688282
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	364.251647
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	599.157922
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	805.026067
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	386.301597
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	264.267529
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	325.282695
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	332.938207
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	281.040319
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	243.785968
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	646.462672
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	357.558025
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	355.557397
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	433.809024
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	331.308890
SOS as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness EOS	353.982473
SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	238.021842
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	584.655787
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	236.907818
SOS not as you represent it EOS	159.211691
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	723.976639
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	1267.171896
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	295.531576
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	359.420890
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	530.368042
SOS they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life EOS	461.669833
SOS you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound EOS	308.162123
SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	268.864486
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	412.059718
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	341.854939
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	498.996412
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	1052.407815
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	671.472525
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	290.473093
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	280.628986
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	351.291368
SOS it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled EOS	503.229266
SOS what does TITLE darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster EOS	356.828559
SOS that is a question which TITLE darcy only can answer EOS	240.061314
SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	245.848870
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	530.735670
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	482.764842
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	503.584185
SOS you are severe on us EOS	266.426368
SOS it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas EOS	302.810599
SOS i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows EOS	369.368794
SOS you are a very strange creature by way of a friend EOS	279.865964
SOS always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body EOS	509.518940
SOS if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers EOS	536.985783
SOS on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must EOS	334.549915
SOS and gravely glancing at TITLE darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song EOS	996.505729
SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	589.090765
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	593.849055
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	949.872702
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	638.281991
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	638.120605
SOS what a charming amusement for young people this is TITLE darcy EOS	356.280925
SOS there is nothing like dancing after all EOS	339.608120
SOS i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies EOS	479.226270
SOS certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world EOS	594.749516
SOS every savage can dance EOS	719.578454
SOS sir william only smiled EOS	517.950877
SOS your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself TITLE darcy EOS	665.474404
SOS you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir EOS	365.720792

SOS you have a house in town i conclude EOS	215.739428
SOS TITLE darcy bowed EOS	299.871194
SOS i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas EOS	499.383524
SOS he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing EOS	466.458858
SOS TITLE darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner EOS	290.189517
SOS you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you EOS	359.131998
SOS and taking her hand he would have given it to TITLE darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing EOS	447.745980
SOS i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner EOS	374.689937

SOS you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour EOS	513.500966
SOS TITLE darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling EOS	304.372185

SOS the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt EOS	649.392206
SOS at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters EOS	531.427926

SOS she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise EOS	567.670478
SOS that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to TITLE hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it EOS	410.322068

SOS their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency EOS	310.353746

SOS yes she called yesterday with her father EOS	296.944588
SOS what an agreeable man sir william is TITLE bingley is not he EOS	287.956628
SOS so much the man of fashion EOS	194.319631
SOS so genteel and so easy EOS	319.114754
SOS he has always something to say to every body EOS	230.561315
SOS that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter EOS	839.244220
SOS did charlotte dine with you EOS	245.569491
SOS no she would go home EOS	187.073302
SOS i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies EOS	605.689532
SOS for my part TITLE bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently EOS	619.008504
SOS but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you EOS	352.544149
SOS it is a pity they are not handsome EOS	228.084777
SOS not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend EOS	323.452009
SOS she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley EOS	397.940251
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS dear yes but you must own she is very plain EOS	279.540047
SOS lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty EOS	495.141429
SOS i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking EOS	383.776513
SOS it is what every body says EOS	283.758760
SOS i do not trust my own partiality EOS	287.907277
SOS when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away EOS	332.358112
SOS but however he did not EOS	119.366449
SOS perhaps he thought her too young EOS	227.753360
SOS however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were EOS	375.368901
SOS and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently EOS	433.975068
SOS there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way EOS	320.694699
SOS i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love EOS	863.727279
SOS i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy EOS	390.349892
SOS of a fine stout healthy love it may EOS	623.647547
SOS every thing nourishes what is strong already EOS	672.136106
SOS but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away EOS	633.894474
SOS darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again EOS	832.681559
SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	407.651662
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	475.098786
SOS she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but TITLE bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage EOS	564.636378
SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	617.736568
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	452.077783
SOS lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age EOS	853.713018
SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	620.423874
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	365.269249
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	538.552423
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	396.816325
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	211.992887
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	461.777711
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	477.883668
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	416.133768
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	339.419751
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	382.476879
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	199.434907
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	494.433988
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	479.201313
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	517.947875
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	566.158838
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	614.268752
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	610.062684
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	278.924836
SOS he made no answer EOS	183.176050
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	699.229646
SOS you are mistaken EOS	168.878727
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	516.230210
SOS how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year EOS	274.538052
SOS letters of business too EOS	278.589258
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	353.037500
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	448.639556
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	216.271034
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	305.551727
SOS i am afraid you do not like your pen EOS	337.007471
SOS let me mend it for you EOS	272.640522
SOS i mend pens remarkably well EOS	1238.336301
SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	374.809954
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	368.475188
SOS he was silent EOS	112.425183
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	472.035315
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	526.783297
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	208.493780
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	118.377652
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	242.742449
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	325.950205
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	366.829512
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	462.789325
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	348.894282
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	730.905522
SOS do not you darcy EOS	94.208120
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	521.598313
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	1352.626055
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	595.838897
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	689.039840
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	851.386353
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	488.220689
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	690.774207
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	369.323919
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	791.529621
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	544.596246
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	519.435878
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	396.617185
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	242.113118
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	697.732076
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	341.198678
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	496.058793
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	305.854290
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	335.569448
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	599.427668
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	466.349287
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	669.518968
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	536.612851
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	407.777264
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	642.602467
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	372.277226
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	384.138489
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	250.233414
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	673.592257
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	276.258568
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	945.793785
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	499.570492
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	644.332455
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	658.222924
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	461.047688
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	484.708719
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	469.664989
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	838.175508
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	269.363076
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	405.731353
SOS perhaps i do EOS	120.842464
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	951.349402
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	353.893526
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	378.008774
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	368.959362
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	288.359586
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	774.867717
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	672.024737
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	327.469818
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	500.247966
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	234.136769
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	310.243373
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	937.328460
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	275.485477
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	310.406557
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	238.867594
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	583.386804
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	370.078259
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	192.635942
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	500.142761
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	253.820684
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	534.022214
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	782.341287
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	614.779318
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	800.292110
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	485.602756
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS yes EOS	98.360056
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	458.198808
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	350.366765
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	364.589053
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	433.750894
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	785.493703
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	338.909936
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	425.691156
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	808.719455
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	383.618520
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	621.430421
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	569.951914
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	391.016214
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	424.687766
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	1353.097493
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	1010.950547
SOS good bye EOS	314.018083
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	526.707796
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	491.175151
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	508.767532
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	424.089903
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	1053.737994
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	287.269572
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	403.126595
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	755.791885
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	217.580311
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	435.592704
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	300.971889
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	447.740545
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	527.112784
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	841.942309
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	276.398731
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	393.812526
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	639.635472
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	683.904794
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	376.130664
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	509.457946
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	528.025314
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	466.966039
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	275.616144
SOS no one made any reply EOS	278.195087
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	875.855830
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	423.505078
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	683.097791
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	707.217804
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	483.183595
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	419.472392
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	423.056329
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	599.018728
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	460.043150
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	523.514516
SOS elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately EOS	227.762717
SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	401.922984
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	420.415701
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	665.472430
SOS what could he mean EOS	159.760014
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	288.405064
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	386.128483
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	653.713505
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	279.547061
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	593.223912
SOS oh EOS	90.688216
SOS shocking EOS	263.990123
SOS cried miss bingley EOS	203.239335

SOS and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject EOS	560.236109
SOS TITLE darcy may hug himself EOS	406.399041
SOS TITLE darcy is not to be laughed at EOS	140.620531

SOS against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow TITLE bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made EOS	789.473263

SOS steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her EOS	509.695494
SOS on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place EOS	649.768400
