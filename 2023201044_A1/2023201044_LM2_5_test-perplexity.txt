SOS darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure EOS	1.417009
SOS miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much EOS	2.949330
SOS TITLE hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of EOS	5.619331
SOS miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose EOS	3.097103
SOS within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate EOS	2.438897
SOS sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty EOS	2.582931
SOS the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly EOS	3.975284
SOS it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world EOS	1.584932
SOS for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body EOS	2.620101
SOS by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st EOS	6.688491
SOS james s had made him courteous EOS	10.064481
SOS lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to TITLE bennet EOS	4.156397
SOS they had several children EOS	9.807018
SOS the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend EOS	2.193634
SOS that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate EOS	2.309518
SOS you began the evening well charlotte said TITLE bennet with civil self command to miss lucas EOS	1.500527
SOS you were TITLE bingley s first choice EOS	5.700315
SOS yes but he seemed to like his second better EOS	6.443150
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice EOS	1.641012
SOS to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about TITLE robinson EOS	3.258689
SOS perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and TITLE robinson did not i mention it to you EOS	1.665292
SOS TITLE robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest EOS	1.658275
SOS and his answering immediately to the last question oh EOS	11.612444
SOS the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point EOS	2.362869
SOS upon my word EOS	397.971717
SOS well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know EOS	1.968875
SOS my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte EOS	2.757233
SOS TITLE darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he EOS	6.267285
SOS poor eliza EOS	11.252224
SOS to be only just tolerable EOS	9.509809
SOS i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him EOS	2.667430
SOS TITLE long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips EOS	3.383041
SOS are you quite sure ma am EOS	231.419718
SOS is not there a little mistake EOS	7.986975
SOS said jane EOS	145.684000
SOS i certainly saw TITLE darcy speaking to her EOS	14.928997
SOS aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to EOS	1.620131
SOS miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance EOS	2.473280
SOS with them he is remarkably agreeable EOS	2.634307
SOS i do not believe a word of it my dear EOS	25.676075
SOS if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to TITLE long EOS	14.213093
SOS but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that TITLE long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise EOS	1.738197
SOS i do not mind his not talking to TITLE long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza EOS	3.244556
SOS another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you EOS	2.024669
SOS i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him EOS	4.049788
SOS his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it EOS	2.819356
SOS one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself EOS	1.569177
SOS if i may so express it he has a right to be proud EOS	4.192035
SOS that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine EOS	7.891863
SOS pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe EOS	1.210488
SOS by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary EOS	1.725984
SOS vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously EOS	1.210488
SOS a person may be proud without being vain EOS	2.105308
SOS pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us EOS	1.210488
SOS if i were as rich as TITLE darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was EOS	3.735622
SOS i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day EOS	3.742035
SOS then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said TITLE bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly EOS	3.260008
SOS the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit EOS	1.927671
SOS the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield EOS	9.454841
SOS the visit was returned in due form EOS	4.612316
SOS miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of TITLE hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest EOS	2.996166
SOS by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration EOS	1.366118
SOS it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent EOS	1.662577
SOS she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas EOS	14.928997
SOS it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded EOS	2.266686
SOS if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark EOS	1.581802
SOS there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself EOS	1.913906
SOS we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement EOS	1.729349
SOS in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels EOS	2.271709
SOS bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on EOS	1.606639
SOS but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow EOS	4.105685
SOS if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too EOS	2.887923
SOS remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do EOS	2.833912
SOS but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out EOS	2.702242
SOS perhaps he must if he sees enough of her EOS	7.300688
SOS but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together EOS	1.993004
SOS jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention EOS	2.193634
SOS when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses EOS	2.195999
SOS your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it EOS	1.365981
SOS but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design EOS	6.086431
SOS as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness EOS	2.126055
SOS she has known him only a fortnight EOS	11.567918
SOS she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times EOS	2.714323
SOS this is not quite enough to make her understand his character EOS	10.209286
SOS not as you represent it EOS	3.020312
SOS had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal EOS	1.760347
SOS yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded EOS	1.383565
SOS well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth EOS	1.543794
SOS happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance EOS	1.210488
SOS if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance their felicity in the least EOS	1.729349
SOS they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life EOS	1.342267
SOS you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound EOS	1.687041
SOS you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself EOS	2.176774
SOS occupied in observing TITLE bingley s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend EOS	1.210488
SOS TITLE darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise EOS	2.744307
SOS but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes EOS	2.470729
SOS to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying EOS	5.546533
SOS though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness EOS	1.690937
SOS of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with EOS	1.475688
SOS he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others EOS	1.857236
SOS his doing so drew her notice EOS	5.583586
SOS it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled EOS	5.583586
SOS what does TITLE darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster EOS	2.193634
SOS that is a question which TITLE darcy only can answer EOS	144.036004
SOS but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about EOS	4.950123
SOS he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him EOS	2.441972
SOS on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think TITLE darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton EOS	1.557996
SOS with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic EOS	1.740029
SOS you are severe on us EOS	5.592345
SOS it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas EOS	12.135622
SOS i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows EOS	18.607681
SOS you are a very strange creature by way of a friend EOS	5.392019
SOS always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body EOS	1.210488
SOS if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers EOS	1.592691
SOS on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must EOS	1.620674
SOS and gravely glancing at TITLE darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song EOS	1.604233
SOS her performance was pleasing though by no means capital EOS	3.529615
SOS after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display EOS	1.857799
SOS mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached EOS	1.433674
SOS elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room EOS	1.687978
SOS TITLE darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began EOS	1.711066
SOS what a charming amusement for young people this is TITLE darcy EOS	5.245333
SOS there is nothing like dancing after all EOS	11.412936
SOS i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies EOS	2.757233
SOS certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world EOS	1.780891
SOS every savage can dance EOS	4.007687
SOS sir william only smiled EOS	19.355477
SOS your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself TITLE darcy EOS	2.085512
SOS you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir EOS	1.743982
SOS yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight EOS	5.534593
SOS do you often dance at st EOS	6.376119
SOS james s EOS	3127.013120
SOS never sir EOS	12.340666
SOS do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place EOS	5.188263
SOS it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it EOS	6.395398
SOS you have a house in town i conclude EOS	13.374489
SOS TITLE darcy bowed EOS	64.786441
SOS i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas EOS	1.973015
SOS he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing EOS	1.493108
SOS TITLE darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner EOS	9.801155
SOS you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you EOS	2.524352
SOS and taking her hand he would have given it to TITLE darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing EOS	1.527554
SOS i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner EOS	2.126055
SOS TITLE darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain EOS	2.931411
SOS elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion EOS	3.975284
SOS you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour EOS	1.310493
SOS TITLE darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling EOS	18.756803
SOS he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner EOS	3.608773
SOS elizabeth looked archly and turned away EOS	15.969720
SOS her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie EOS	1.674167
SOS i should imagine not EOS	32.767525
SOS you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion EOS	1.700814
SOS i was never more annoyed EOS	1001.576257
SOS the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people EOS	2.193634
SOS what would i give to hear your strictures on them EOS	9.454841
SOS your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you EOS	2.099210
SOS my mind was more agreeably engaged EOS	5.583586
SOS i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow EOS	3.035898
SOS miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections EOS	1.967765

SOS and pray when am i to wish you joy EOS	7.940520
SOS that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask EOS	4.926303

SOS i knew you would be wishing me joy EOS	8.358482
SOS nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled EOS	1.950252
SOS you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you EOS	1.956399
SOS he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long EOS	1.709563
SOS TITLE bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his EOS	1.908169
SOS her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds EOS	7.876902
SOS she had a sister married to a TITLE philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade EOS	2.193634
SOS the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way EOS	1.520012
SOS the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt EOS	1.592790
SOS at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters EOS	1.735334
SOS their visits to TITLE philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence EOS	1.775474
SOS every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections EOS	4.345871
SOS their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves EOS	1.630597
SOS TITLE philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before EOS	4.251043
SOS they could talk of nothing but officers and TITLE bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign EOS	1.726117
SOS after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject TITLE bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country EOS	1.392605
SOS i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced EOS	4.453147
SOS catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london EOS	1.914989

SOS when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do EOS	2.039321
SOS i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals EOS	1.696376

SOS my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better EOS	2.470615

SOS yours c EOS	179855.272349
SOS well my dear said TITLE bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of TITLE bingley and under your orders EOS	3.820789
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838

SOS as long as she stays there it is all very well EOS	2.953019
SOS i would go and see her if i could have the carriage EOS	4.855330

SOS she declared her resolution EOS	10.291870
SOS how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt EOS	5.704712
SOS you will not be fit to be seen when you get there EOS	5.151024

SOS no indeed EOS	111.001602

SOS i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required EOS	2.353819
SOS we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia EOS	10.293303
SOS elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together EOS	6.891547
SOS if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes EOS	2.929816
SOS in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise EOS	1.423573
SOS she was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise EOS	2.312495
SOS that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to TITLE hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it EOS	4.237590
SOS she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness EOS	2.152014
SOS TITLE darcy said very little and TITLE hurst nothing at all EOS	4.561787
SOS the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone EOS	1.729349
SOS the latter was thinking only of his breakfast EOS	39.445394
SOS her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered EOS	3.202402
SOS miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room EOS	3.917008
SOS elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance EOS	1.991274
SOS she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with EOS	2.533124
SOS elizabeth silently attended her EOS	10.291870
SOS when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane EOS	1.409025
SOS the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts EOS	2.047972
SOS the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely EOS	2.362869
SOS elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere EOS	3.568809
SOS when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so EOS	2.305609
SOS miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present EOS	1.559060
SOS elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes EOS	1.826909
SOS at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner EOS	1.551977
SOS to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of TITLE bingley s she could not make a very favourable answer EOS	1.811120
SOS jane was by no means better EOS	15.969720
SOS the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike EOS	1.442619
SOS their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency EOS	3.159934
SOS his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others EOS	1.674167
SOS she had very little notice from any but him EOS	10.291870
SOS miss bingley was engrossed by TITLE darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for TITLE hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her EOS	1.874610
SOS when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room EOS	3.234725
SOS her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty EOS	1.826909
SOS TITLE hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker EOS	3.552728
SOS i shall never forget her appearance this morning EOS	28.408411

SOS yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office EOS	1.750911
SOS your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me EOS	1.620095
SOS i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning EOS	3.407809
SOS her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice EOS	4.612316
SOS you observed it TITLE darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition EOS	4.311499
SOS certainly not EOS	18.059227
SOS to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone EOS	1.488063
SOS what could she mean by it EOS	19.473340
SOS it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum EOS	3.200578
SOS it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley EOS	2.599781
SOS i am afraid TITLE darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes EOS	3.833101
SOS not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise EOS	8.212107
SOS a short pause followed this speech and TITLE hurst began again EOS	4.945655

SOS but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it EOS	6.263915
SOS i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton EOS	317.684989
SOS yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside EOS	3.917580
SOS that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily EOS	4.926303
SOS if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable EOS	3.552728
SOS but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy EOS	5.076280
SOS to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations EOS	1.833369
SOS with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee EOS	2.024391
SOS she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself EOS	1.709587
SOS on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book EOS	2.117152
SOS TITLE hurst looked at her with astonishment EOS	20.436872
SOS do you prefer reading to cards EOS	6.376119
SOS said he that is rather singular EOS	7.734626
SOS miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards EOS	2.169857
SOS she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else EOS	18.227166
SOS i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things EOS	1.890659
SOS in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well EOS	1.826909
SOS elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying EOS	2.126055
SOS he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded EOS	2.757233
SOS and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into EOS	2.031113
SOS elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room EOS	2.470615
SOS i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books EOS	3.734124
SOS what a delightful library you have at pemberley TITLE darcy EOS	5.993288
SOS it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations EOS	22.038537
SOS and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books EOS	7.687026

SOS charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley EOS	1.210488
SOS i wish it may EOS	44.815896
SOS but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model EOS	2.495959
SOS there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire EOS	9.314226
SOS with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it EOS	3.849054
SOS i am talking of possibilities charles EOS	25.755261
SOS upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation EOS	4.100458
SOS elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between TITLE bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game EOS	1.947706
SOS is miss darcy much grown since the spring EOS	2.319119
SOS said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am EOS	1.934635

SOS such a countenance such manners EOS	11.588798
SOS and so extremely accomplished for her age EOS	10.303790
SOS her performance on the piano forte is exquisite EOS	3.975284

SOS all young ladies accomplished EOS	4.134017
SOS my dear charles what do you mean EOS	39.077532
SOS yes all of them i think EOS	2.406846
SOS they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses EOS	5.959127
SOS i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished EOS	2.708706
SOS your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth EOS	1.684293
SOS the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen EOS	1.927671
SOS but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general EOS	4.975105
SOS i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished EOS	2.576400
SOS nor i i am sure said miss bingley EOS	2.624741
SOS then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman EOS	1.815862
SOS yes i do comprehend a great deal in it EOS	4.405788
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with EOS	1.722094
SOS a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved EOS	1.645610
SOS all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading EOS	2.306351
SOS i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women EOS	15.697473
SOS i rather wonder now at your knowing any EOS	10.503493
SOS are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this EOS	2.593646
SOS i never saw such a woman EOS	1318.350541
SOS i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united EOS	12.258323
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when TITLE hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward EOS	3.862707
SOS as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room EOS	2.470615
SOS eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds EOS	1.618474
SOS but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art EOS	4.254023
SOS undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation EOS	1.913736
SOS whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable EOS	3.057641
SOS miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject EOS	5.443967
SOS elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her EOS	3.749229
SOS bingley urged TITLE jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians EOS	1.446266
SOS this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that TITLE jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better EOS	2.553773
SOS bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable EOS	3.772830
SOS they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister EOS	1.338804
SOS elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from TITLE bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters EOS	1.812638
SOS in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation EOS	2.969139
SOS the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with EOS	2.757233
SOS TITLE bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast EOS	3.200869
SOS had she found jane in any apparent danger TITLE bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield EOS	1.638532
SOS she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable EOS	2.901150
SOS after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour EOS	3.000289
SOS bingley met them with hopes that TITLE bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected EOS	1.710970

SOS TITLE bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments EOS	19.528984
SOS i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with EOS	3.238333

SOS i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful EOS	3.852725
SOS that is as it happens EOS	20.048501
SOS it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours EOS	5.034190
SOS lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home EOS	1.543839
SOS i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character EOS	20.428862
SOS it must be an amusing study EOS	43.107694
SOS yes but intricate characters are the most amusing EOS	7.758544
SOS they have at least that advantage EOS	6.157177
SOS the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study EOS	2.362869
SOS in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society EOS	4.192035

SOS yes indeed cried TITLE bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood EOS	3.690220
SOS i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town EOS	4.639377
SOS every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away EOS	3.468287
SOS TITLE bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph EOS	3.200869
SOS i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places EOS	4.426928

SOS when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same EOS	4.481234
SOS they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either EOS	2.730053
SOS aye that is because you have the right disposition EOS	2.902214

SOS indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother EOS	2.005856
SOS you quite mistook TITLE darcy EOS	2.224658
SOS he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true EOS	2.572062
SOS certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger EOS	1.653453
SOS i know we dine with four and twenty families EOS	6.377885

SOS she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence TITLE bennet began repeating her thanks to TITLE bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy EOS	2.372537
SOS TITLE bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required EOS	2.519804

SOS upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward EOS	5.835148
SOS the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax TITLE bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield EOS	1.844657

SOS she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance EOS	2.158668
SOS she was very equal therefore to address TITLE bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it EOS	3.912336
SOS his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear EOS	2.599781
SOS i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball EOS	3.237270
SOS but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill EOS	29.273461
SOS lydia declared herself satisfied EOS	4.067941
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again EOS	1.456540
SOS and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also EOS	3.311466
SOS i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not EOS	3.393215
SOS TITLE bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and TITLE darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes EOS	2.706991
SOS the day passed much as the day before had done EOS	20.936248
SOS TITLE hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room EOS	4.240869
SOS the loo table however did not appear EOS	4.612316
SOS TITLE darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister EOS	2.772035
SOS TITLE hurst and TITLE bingley were at piquet and TITLE hurst was observing their game EOS	10.469720
SOS elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion EOS	3.200578
SOS the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each EOS	1.499387
SOS how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter EOS	1.759679
SOS he made no answer EOS	6102.709043
SOS you write uncommonly fast EOS	2.512603
SOS you are mistaken EOS	12.020174
SOS i write rather slowly EOS	111.400425
SOS how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year EOS	11.245496
SOS letters of business too EOS	1.210488
SOS how odious i should think them EOS	2.298718
SOS it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours EOS	5.042544
SOS pray tell your sister that i long to see her EOS	18.588019
SOS i have already told her so once by your desire EOS	5.012967
SOS i am afraid you do not like your pen EOS	51.785030
SOS let me mend it for you EOS	6.372840
SOS i mend pens remarkably well EOS	7.203971
SOS thank you but i always mend my own EOS	7.242550
SOS how can you contrive to write so even EOS	12.002422
SOS he was silent EOS	68.527256
SOS tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s EOS	1.432613
SOS will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again EOS	3.462139
SOS at present i have not room to do them justice EOS	9.002316
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS it is of no consequence EOS	312.016352
SOS i shall see her in january EOS	383.589189
SOS but do you always write such charming long letters to her TITLE darcy EOS	10.335237
SOS they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine EOS	10.480912
SOS it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill EOS	4.657694
SOS that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease EOS	3.055768
SOS he studies too much for words of four syllables EOS	3.529615
SOS do not you darcy EOS	136.744198
SOS my style of writing is very different from yours EOS	3.529615
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable EOS	1.934635
SOS he leaves out half his words and blots the rest EOS	3.202402
SOS my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents EOS	1.773979
SOS your humility TITLE bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof EOS	1.986764
SOS nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility EOS	2.068612
SOS it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast EOS	6.280388
SOS and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty EOS	2.470615
SOS the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting EOS	1.592691
SOS the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance EOS	4.347150
SOS when you told TITLE bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else EOS	1.547702
SOS nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning EOS	1.749910
SOS and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment EOS	2.742391
SOS at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies EOS	2.850229
SOS i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity EOS	11.404337
SOS your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month EOS	1.322472
SOS you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that TITLE bingley did not do justice to his own disposition EOS	1.967229
SOS you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself EOS	2.555132
SOS i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper EOS	3.069768
SOS but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could EOS	1.996929
SOS would TITLE darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it EOS	1.749910
SOS upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself EOS	5.677165
SOS you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged EOS	1.452952
SOS allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety EOS	1.210488
SOS to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you EOS	1.649877
SOS to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either EOS	1.772099
SOS you appear to me TITLE darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection EOS	1.500527
SOS a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it EOS	1.489682
SOS i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about TITLE bingley EOS	6.149886
SOS we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon EOS	10.529911
SOS but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it EOS	1.746480
SOS will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties EOS	1.454881
SOS by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of EOS	1.465984
SOS i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference EOS	4.307509
SOS i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do EOS	1.629530
SOS TITLE darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh EOS	2.683275
SOS miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense EOS	2.221909
SOS i see your design bingley said his friend EOS	9.786206
SOS you dislike an argument and want to silence this EOS	1.743982
SOS perhaps i do EOS	49.023123
SOS arguments are too much like disputes EOS	1.210488
SOS if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me EOS	2.084104
SOS what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and TITLE darcy had much better finish his letter EOS	2.015014
SOS TITLE darcy took her advice and did finish his letter EOS	44.861247
SOS when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music EOS	1.538526
SOS miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself EOS	1.749116
SOS TITLE hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently TITLE darcy s eyes were fixed on her EOS	3.864109
SOS she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange EOS	1.629530
SOS she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present EOS	1.932624
SOS the supposition did not pain her EOS	5.583586
SOS she liked him too little to care for his approbation EOS	3.202402
SOS after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards TITLE darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel EOS	1.358336
SOS she smiled but made no answer EOS	5.583586
SOS he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence EOS	3.202402
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply EOS	4.840684
SOS you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt EOS	1.336043
SOS i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare EOS	2.075133
SOS indeed i do not dare EOS	12.838325
SOS elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her EOS	1.505951
SOS he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger EOS	2.067016
SOS miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth EOS	2.509254
SOS she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance EOS	1.857236
SOS i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers EOS	2.514987
SOS and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses EOS	3.536408
SOS have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity EOS	7.593905
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS yes EOS	1062.952055
SOS do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley EOS	1.634177
SOS put them next to your great uncle the judge EOS	1.210488
SOS they are in the same profession you know only in different lines EOS	2.760861
SOS as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes EOS	2.426948
SOS it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied EOS	2.336544
SOS at that moment they were met from another walk by TITLE hurst and elizabeth herself EOS	4.604481
SOS i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard EOS	6.873712
SOS you used us abominably ill answered TITLE hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out EOS	1.452952
SOS then taking the disengaged arm of TITLE darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself EOS	1.862475
SOS the path just admitted three EOS	7.203971
SOS TITLE darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party EOS	2.931411
SOS we had better go into the avenue EOS	60.971346
SOS but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are EOS	5.226836
SOS you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage EOS	2.789252
SOS the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth EOS	3.529615
SOS good bye EOS	26299.981364
SOS she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two EOS	4.053905
SOS jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening EOS	5.415973
SOS when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared EOS	1.690268
SOS their powers of conversation were considerable EOS	2.604163
SOS they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit EOS	2.292756
SOS but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object EOS	4.685840
SOS miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps EOS	2.890696
SOS he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation TITLE hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation EOS	1.643429
SOS he was full of joy and attention EOS	9.107766
SOS the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door EOS	3.205511
SOS he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else EOS	4.254023
SOS elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight EOS	6.086431
SOS when tea was over TITLE hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain EOS	1.538526
SOS she had obtained private intelligence that TITLE darcy did not wish for cards and TITLE hurst soon found even his open petition rejected EOS	2.953019
SOS she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her EOS	1.890659
SOS TITLE hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep EOS	3.552728
SOS darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and TITLE hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet EOS	1.436272
SOS miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching TITLE darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page EOS	2.129006
SOS she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on EOS	4.643195
SOS at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way EOS	1.552517
SOS i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading EOS	3.202402
SOS how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book EOS	3.024004
SOS when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library EOS	2.153547
SOS no one made any reply EOS	9.284626
SOS she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield EOS	1.681772
SOS i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure EOS	3.361463
SOS if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards EOS	1.745727
SOS i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting EOS	2.663568
SOS it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day EOS	2.977145
SOS much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball EOS	1.835705
SOS miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room EOS	5.443967
SOS her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious EOS	2.015014
SOS in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room EOS	1.932624
SOS i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude EOS	14.684427
SOS elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately EOS	129.540038
SOS miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility TITLE darcy looked up EOS	2.473280
SOS he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book EOS	3.895914
SOS he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere EOS	2.189398
SOS what could he mean EOS	59.160586
SOS she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him EOS	2.536535
SOS not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it EOS	2.481822
SOS miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing TITLE darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives EOS	2.008008
SOS i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak EOS	10.244675
SOS you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire EOS	1.280435
SOS oh EOS	53781.126838
SOS shocking EOS	1.210488
SOS cried miss bingley EOS	4.941699
SOS i never heard any thing so abominable EOS	113.808780
SOS how shall we punish him for such a speech EOS	6.239135
SOS nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth EOS	2.068612
SOS we can all plague and punish one another EOS	3.975284
SOS teaze him laugh at him EOS	1.210488
SOS intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done EOS	2.833912
SOS but upon my honour i do not EOS	4.612316
SOS i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that EOS	22.676981
SOS teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind EOS	1.210488
SOS no no i feel he may defy us there EOS	4.086682
SOS and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject EOS	3.200578
SOS TITLE darcy may hug himself EOS	125.113261
SOS TITLE darcy is not to be laughed at EOS	18.756803
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	970.095312
SOS that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance EOS	3.510997
SOS i dearly love a laugh EOS	7.203971
SOS miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be EOS	6.748307
SOS the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke EOS	1.709563
SOS certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them EOS	3.929378
SOS i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good EOS	5.745802
SOS follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can EOS	1.210488
SOS but these i suppose are precisely what you are without EOS	9.454841
SOS perhaps that is not possible for any one EOS	2.373629
SOS but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule EOS	2.593330
SOS such as vanity and pride EOS	3.368762
SOS yes vanity is a weakness indeed EOS	2.406846
SOS but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation EOS	2.193634
SOS elizabeth turned away to hide a smile EOS	4.612316
SOS your examination of TITLE darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result EOS	2.940524
SOS i am perfectly convinced by it that TITLE darcy has no defect EOS	11.717886
SOS he owns it himself without disguise EOS	5.583586
SOS no said darcy i have made no such pretension EOS	4.695383
SOS i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding EOS	10.069187
SOS my temper i dare not vouch for EOS	4.612316

SOS my good opinion once lost is lost for ever EOS	27.841505
SOS that is a failing indeed EOS	145.906857
SOS cried elizabeth EOS	970.095312
SOS implacable resentment is a shade in a character EOS	1.210488
SOS but you have chosen your fault well EOS	10.918913
SOS i really cannot laugh at it EOS	30.603070
SOS you are safe from me EOS	5.592345
SOS there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome EOS	1.845032
SOS and your defect is a propensity to hate every body EOS	9.454841
SOS and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them EOS	2.757233
SOS do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share EOS	1.565595
SOS louisa you will not mind my waking TITLE hurst EOS	3.982508
SOS her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it EOS	2.888275
SOS he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention EOS	2.757233
SOS in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day EOS	2.092221
SOS but TITLE bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before EOS	3.785806
SOS her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home EOS	3.552728
SOS TITLE bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if TITLE bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well EOS	1.769145
SOS against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow TITLE bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made EOS	1.210488
SOS the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred EOS	1.643429
SOS miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other EOS	2.950508
SOS the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right EOS	1.920264
